        <h3>This book started with a little-known fact:</h3>
        <div id="ellieContentParagraphs">
          <p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman's_Christian_Temperance_Union">Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union</a> is still the largest  women&rsquo;s movement the world has ever known.</p>
          <p>In other words, the  19th Century women, who  wanted to put an end to drinking alcohol, managed to organize more women than  any woman&rsquo;s organization before or since.</p>
          <p>Yet they were wrong-headed. </p>
          <p>They understood the problem. They were deeply concerned  about abused women and other issues that we would recognize today. However,  their idea was to reform men rather than change laws to protect women. If they  could close the saloons and put an end to &ldquo;demon rum,&rdquo; they thought that men  everywhere would become gentlemen. </p>
          <p>Ironically, at the same time, many 19th Century women braved the  American frontier because they wanted to own land and open their own  businesses; opportunities (rights) denied them in the more settled east. </p>
          <p>What if a woman saloon-owner were to be confronted with a  woman temperance leader determined to close her down? What if the two women loved  the same man? <em>Miss Ellie&rsquo;s Purple Sage Saloon</em> grew out of those two questions.</p>

        <h1>Interesting Tidbits:</h1>
        <ul>

          <li><p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wctu.org">Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union</a> still exists. It is the oldest continuing non-sectarian women&rsquo;s organization in the world. To join you sign a pledge not drink alcohol and pay annual dues.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usiap.org/Archives/NewsArticles/NA2000_07_09B.html">WCTU</a> managed to dry up the United States for 13 years. From 1920 to 1933, it was illegal to sell, manufacture, or transport alcohol. This is known as the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States">Prohibition Era</a>. This was accomplished by the passage of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.</p></li>
          <li><p>Various organizations have been trying to pass the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a> since 1923 without success.</p></li>
          <li><p>Woman on woman conflict is unusual enough that novels, like this one, often get singled out for that particular focus. It's more common for the conflict to be between a man and a woman, even in women's fiction.</p></li>
