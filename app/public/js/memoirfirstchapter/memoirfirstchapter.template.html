          <h3><b>A Train-Stopping Love Story</b></h3>
          <p class="currentBlurbParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family tells one story more often than any other—the story of my great grandmother Sophia and the railroad she took hostage. Around our kitchen table, Sophia’s story is told heroic style, meaning we don’t just tell the story, we brag. Our grandmother didn’t stop one or two trains. She brought an entire railroad to a standstill. No surprise, there are several versions of the story, and every reason to believe it’s exaggerated. Stories get better over time. That said, it seems to be based on a real incident. And, more important, it’s a good story.<br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1879, when Sophia was fourteen years old, she ran away from home because of an abusive stepfather and got a job working for the railroad. She weighed less than a hundred pounds, a detail my family adds because, in this case, size matters. Working for the railroad was no easy town job. She began as a cook’s helper and later became a cook—part of a crew of women who fed the men who were laying railroad tracks across some of the last outposts of the American frontier. The job consisted of fixing dinner at night and breakfast the next morning in one place. Then, while the men were laying track, the women loaded their tent kitchen onto mules and moved four or five miles down the roadbed—the distance the men were expected to get that day. Then they unloaded their mules, set up camp, and had dinner ready by the time the men caught up with them. This was hard, backbreaking work, done six and a half days a week.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was dangerous.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooks were often out ahead of the men at a time when marauding Indians were marauding mainly because they were hungry. Besides that, the job had its own hazards. Sophia knew a girl who was crippled when one of the mules fell on her, and another who was blinded when one of the stoves exploded. Those tragedies were felt keenly, because the women formed extraordinarily close bonds in as much as they were constantly “watching out for each other”—a polite euphemism for the fact that one occupational danger was from the men on those same crews “who might not be gentlemen” or “might forget themselves” while working in remote places. Add to that the usual hazards—sudden storms, bad water, and medical emergencies. The list goes on and on . . ..<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, none matched the raw, unregulated competition between rival railroads that sometimes led to two companies laying track through the same narrow canyon. The company that finished first got paid. The other got nothing. In that race, both company’s crews were often guarded by armed men, who hardly needed an excuse to start shooting. What’s more, since everyone knew that crews worked best on full stomachs, kidnapping the competition’s cooks was considered fair game.<br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think those railroad-building details are interesting, but I’m not under the impression that this part of my family’s history is extraordinary. In times past, life was physically hard, and lots of people had to overcame all kinds of gritty difficulties. Does that matter? Recent research at the University of Graz has identified an “ancestor effect.” Individuals who think about their ancestors just prior to a job interview or college exam boost their chances of success. Dr. Peter Fischer hypothesizes that “thinking about one’s origins . . . provides people with a positive psychological resource.” In other words, when I remind myself of the difficulties my ancestors overcame, I am able to approach my own challenges with a greater sense of identity and self-confidence—<em>if my great grandmother Sophia brought an entire railroad to at standstill, I can do this. I’m made of the same stuff</em>.  Evidently that attitude can make a measurable difference, which is probably why most families continue to tell stories that emphasize how hard it used to be and/or what amazing, resourceful people we come from. And my family is no different. <br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sophia’s case, she not only overcame the day-to-day difficulties, she stood up for herself. She was still young—nineteen years old—when she fell in love. He was the crew foreman, and, when he proposed marriage, she accepted with one condition. Before they set a wedding date, she had to collect her back pay.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The railroad company was having financial difficulties. As a result, everyone working for that particular company was owed considerable back pay. She was owed more than a year’s worth. That became the young couple’s first disagreement. George, her fiancée, doubted that Sophia would ever collect all that was due her. Most of the so-called “skilled men,” like him, would eventually settle for less than what they were owed. As a lowly cook, she’d be lucky to get anything. He wanted her to forget the money and come away with him. Together they would make do on hard work.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia had great respect for hard work—she’d certainly done her share—but she’d been poor all her life. She was not going to start her married life with just the clothes on her back. On that point, she was adamant. She would marry George when she got her back pay and not one day sooner.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Word of the young couple’s impasse spread up and down the railroad lines. In the five years that she’d worked with various crews, a great many railroad workers had met and come to like Sophia. More to the point, they knew she was strong willed. Most were not betting on George being able to change her mind. Soon the story of the young lovers and their standoff changed to sympathy for George’s plight. Then sympathy changed to action.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strike started when the men in the camp, where Sophia was working, quit early one day for her sake. Once started, the strike spread quickly. Next day, it had jumped to two more camps. Three days later, it involved several more camps. Men, who were laying track in three directions, simply put down their tools and refused to go on—not because they hoped to get their own pay—but because they wanted to see Sophia married in style.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The railroad bosses fired her. Without an easy alternative, they must have thought that she’d give up, get married, and move on. <img id="sophia" src="./img/sophia.png">If so, they were wrong. Sophia stood her ground, the men refused to return to work, and the strike continued to spread. Probably because the railroad bosses got stubborn, the strike went on much longer than anyone might have imagined in a situation where no one got paid unless they laid track fast and finished first. However, in the end, it was the bosses who gave in. They paid Sophia and her husband-to-be what they were owed. It is said that her wedding included a band that played all night and guests who danced even longer “when they had to whistle their own tune to keep celebrating.”<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia and George’s back wages, combined with her savings, were enough to buy approximately one hundred and sixty acres in southeastern Idaho. Those acres were the beginning of a sheep and cattle ranch that would include thousands of acres by the time I knew her—when she was in her nineties and I was nine-years-old.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandma Melba ran the ranch after her. Now my mother is responsible for the largest remaining piece, which is still a couple thousand acres. Meanwhile, I live in a Colorado college town where being stuck in traffic might tempt me to forget my heritage if it weren’t for that story. Even when I try to ignore it, that story hangs over my life, telling me I can do anything on a good day; chiding me for not conquering the world on a bad one. What I didn’t appreciate, while riding my daily rollercoaster, is how often I think about that story. Until I started paying attention, I had assumed that the story existed mostly as deep background. I left home when I was nineteen, and I’ve never lived closer than a thousand miles since. I assumed I was my own woman, making my own decisions, too busy—far too busy—to wonder why a thousand miles insulated me from stories I’d heard a thousand times. Truth is, I suspect most people shrug off the family stories, not only because they’re just stories, but because they are the same old stories. We think we know them until we stop and really pay attention. In my case, I was focused on our love stories. Sophia stopping the trains is only one.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also tell the story of a young girl rescued by a young man riding a white horse. I’m not kidding. The story is exactly that cliché. This one is about Melba, my grandmother, the second woman to run the family ranch. I affectionately call her “Auntie Mame in Boots,” because <em>Auntie Mame</em> was her favorite movie, and because she spend most of her life trying to be more madcap than the movie’s main character. It’s an oldie—1958—starring Rosalind Russell. Move the scene from a New York apartment to a sheep ranch in Idaho and you get the picture. Or, if you haven’t seen the movie—think Madonna or Lady Gaga.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melba met Sophia’s youngest son, Irvin, at a summer dance. She was sixteen, living with an older, married sister who had children of her own and resented the extra mouth to feed. Melba remembers hard work and never having anything nice (meaning clothes) to call her own. Irvin, on the other hand, was handsome, funny, well to do, and literally rode a white horse.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By that time, Sophia and her family had prospered and were known as “The White Horse Nielsens” because even their wagon horses were light-colored grays, notably well bred. All that next fall and winter, Melba watched for Irvin and went out to greet him whenever he rode past her house on his way to pick up a wagonload of beet pulp, a by-product of processing sugar beets that is fed to livestock in winter. Unfortunately it is a notoriously fragrant by-product. Melba teased him about courting her while “smelling worse than vinegar.” In turn, he accused her of liking his horse more than she liked him.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not the only one to notice that Melba had an eye for a good horse as well as a good man. The neighbors had begun to gossip. It sounds juvenile when you put it on paper, but we usually tell this story with an attitude of mockery, as if pitying those poor neighbors who didn’t seem to understand that any woman in her right mind would always choose both—the fine gentleman and the good horse.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing our love-story tradition, my father supposedly proposed to my mother in the fourth grade. We have a picture in the family photo album of the two of them and their fourth grade class. Nothing out of the ordinary, it’s a school picture—three rows of 1930s schoolchildren lined up on the steps of their schoolhouse. Everyone is looking at the camera except my dad. He has taken a step back and cast a sideways glance at my mother, who’s standing next to him. It’s such a fun, sweet picture; you want to believe the story of their fourth-grade love. On second thought, the picture is too perfect. I studied the photo a moment and then wondered, which came first, the story or the picture? With that in mind, I asked my aunts, one by one, if my mother or my father had ever been interested in anyone else. They claim not. So, what can I say? Either the story is true, or the story has been repeated so many times it has replaced memory.<br><br><br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sister, Sharen, an engineer with several patents to her name, has never been impressed with the family love stories. When I explain my new interest in those old stories, she rolls her eyes. “You mean the family fairytales?”<br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw a deep breath. Are they mostly make-believe?<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stories are a mix of lies and truth. That doesn’t change the power—the hold—they have on us.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an example. A hundred and fifty years ago, there was a legendary “tie yourself down” stretch of railroad along Beaver Canyon, one of the places Sophia worked. The road was so rough a crew was stationed there with the sole purpose of cleaning up after the cars that weren’t tied down and therefore lost their load on the rocks below. “Tie yourself down,” meaning prepare for a rough ride, is a phrase I whisper to give myself courage. I whispered it long before I knew the term originated with my family’s railroad background. Most of us have no idea how deep the stories go. We never question our family’s way of describing the world. “Tie yourself down,” we say and go on like that’s the only way.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here’s the sad part of my parent’s story. My father served in World War II. Besides having his feet frozen in the Battle of the Bulge, he was one of the first paratroopers to jump into Germany across the Rhine River. I’m told that the survivors of that jump, few in number, talked about whether any of them would get out alive. In a sense, none did. It is the unanimous opinion of the family that my father “never got over the war.” To make a long story short, my mother married a young man who was different from the one she fell in love with when they were both in the fourth grade. Sophia’s love story didn’t end like a fairytale either. She was a widow longer than she was married. In both cases, however, those are not the stories we choose to tell most often.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, my grandma Melba, the one who married the fine young man riding the white horse, was skeptical of fairytales. She read to me when I was a child and whenever she got to the end of Cinderella, she always paused and added, “We like the prince. There’s nothing nicer than a fine, handsome prince, but YOU need to pay attention to the fairy godmother. She’s the one who got things done.”<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a child, I thought she was being silly. I knew that was not how the story went. I also never forgot. Later, as a teenager, remembering her version of that story, I amused myself thinking she was talking about women, like herself, older and largely unappreciated. I liked the twist. I thought: <em>Good for her, we all need to get a dig in once in a while.</em> Years and years later, I remember and think she was wise—wiser than I knew. Now I think, “pay attention to the fairy godmother” means notice how your family tells their stories.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in my family we have tales we call, Oh Dear Me’s. As a child, I was allowed to tell an Oh Dear Me once, as a way to rant against the unfairness of the world, but I was never encouraged to repeat one. The family attitude was that nothing would be accomplished by such a re-telling, except to wallow in self-pity.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know another family that handles hard times by referring to them as memories. “We’ve just made a memory,” they’ll say in the face of some new setback. That’s their way of creating an emotional safety net. According to their scheme of things, you have no way to lose. No matter what happens, you’re always richer in memories.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once when I had an occasion to spend several weeks in Ireland, I watched a mother and her young daughter stop frequently at the graveyard across the street from where I was staying. Later I found out they were visiting the grave of the child’s sister, her twin. The mother seemed to think it was important for the living child to share her memories, almost daily, with the stillborn sister. When I heard that story, I couldn’t help wondering how deeply that ritual would affect the living child. Would she feel the burden of living for two? Or would she come to think that she was luckier than most because she had an unseen sister to share her life? Either way, she would not escape the story of her birth. None of us do. And unless we make a conscious choice, our stories can get stuck in our heads.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We are the White Horse Nielsens.”<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We don’t tell <em>Oh dear me’s</em>.”<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“WE STOP TRAINS.”<br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, right, and how many trains have we stopped lately?” my sister, Sharen, the no-nonsense engineer asks.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly.<br><br><br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Cinderella-imbued culture, when a woman marries the man of her dreams, she’s supposed to live happily ever after. My parents had one perfect moment. Right after he returned from the war, my father took my mother to the local Saturday night dance. He was still in his uniform. She was flushed with the happiness of having him home. When he took her in his arms and started to dance, everyone else stepped back and let them have the floor. And then, when the dance was over, everyone applauded. Moments like that are rare. And don’t prepare us to deal with the disappointment that inevitably follows.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, we keep telling stories, repeating them in endless variations, because we love stories. I can’t imagine who I’d be without my stories. Who doesn’t stand, fight, walk away—or tell love stories—based on some notion of what the people in her family does. I do. For reasons I have yet to understand, my ancestors decided that to hold a family together, you need a good love story. And so, when it’s my turn, I tell The Porsche story.<br><br><br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My husband-to-be courted me in a brand-new Porsche 912. I didn’t know much about cars at the time, still don’t. My excuse is growing up on that ranch in Idaho. On a ranch, you drive the kind of vehicles that handle dirt roads and lots of dust. Old pickup trucks, mainly. Of course, I appreciated the new car shininess and the new car smell, but I had no idea that a Porsche was more than just another German-made car. In fact, I thought it was just a flattened version of a Volkswagen.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, until that fall when I went back to college. The first weekend he came to see me, my roommates’ mouths dropped. “He drives a Porsche?” they asked in near unison. I nodded; too embarrassed to admit that I didn’t know I was supposed to be impressed.<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when I tell the story, I always add that whatever it was that impressed me, it wasn’t his car. Over the years, the story has deepened and distilled, as stories do, until there are times when “Honey, you don’t need a Porsche” is enough said.</p><br><br>
