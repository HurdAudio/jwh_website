          <br />
          Sioux Falls <br>
          South Dakota <br>
          April 1891</p><br>
          <p><strong>T</strong>he buffalo charged straight at Kate.<br>
            <br>
            She'd never seen a buffalo except in photographs. Then grouped together, the  animals had looked small and slow-moving against the wide expanse of prairie  and sky whitened from overexposure. This one was a huge hump of brown, matted  fur, black eyes, black nose, black horns, and flared nostrils blowing a fog  ahead of itself. This one was close enough to smell and coming closer. And  worse it was dragging an Indian.<br />
            <br />
            Kate steadied her camera against the fence railing and worked  quickly-aperture, focus, slide the plate in . . .<br />
            <br />
            Townswomen grabbed their children and ran. The wild west  exhibitioner who owned the buffalo, climbed the fence, whip in hand. Other  Indians leaped to the fence top whooping and hollering. All around people  exclaimed the insanity:<br />
            <br />
    &quot;He'll be killed.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    &quot;Damned crazy Indian . . .&quot;<br />
    <br />
    &quot;Fool thing. What does he . . .&quot;<br />
    <br />
    &quot;I've never seen . . .&quot;<br />
    <br />
          But Kate had seen. She had watched a tremor rack the  Indian's body as he threw himself against the startled wide-eyed bull in what  could only be called an embrace-his fingers clawing the shaggy mane the way  hers now clutched the fence top. And she knew . . . the Indian was not crazy.  She couldn't explain it. Sometimes she saw things like that with a clarity that  invaded her dreams, the images burned into her soul, and sometimes when she was  lucky, she captured them on the gelatin of her photographic plates. She lived  for those moments.<br />
          <br />
          The Indian, a thin, crooked-armed man, past the prime of his life, threw  back his head and sang out sharp and high-pitched, &quot;Hey, ya na  hah . . .&quot; or some gibberish like that, and she thought again: maybe, this  was crazy. Then it happened-the perfect orchestration of light and shadow, form  and frame, even the angle of the sunlight on the dust roiling up under the  beast. How many chances did one get to capture the image of an elderly Sioux  warrior hugging a buffalo? She clicked the shutter. <br />
          <br />
            Then the animal slammed against the opposite side of the fence where she  still clung. The force was enough to split the top two rails. One broken rail  punched her in the stomach and sent her flying. She threw her arms around her  camera to protect it from the fall and landed flat on her back, the wind  knocked out, her own focus blurred. She couldn't immediately catch her breath,  and her dizziness grew. Still she worked her fingers over her camera feeling  its various parts, checking for damage. Thankfully the camera seemed to be all  right. That was about as important to her as breathing. Good cameras were hard  to replace, in her case, next to impossible. <br />
            <br />
            Just as she was on the verge of losing consciousness, she became aware of  her husband leaning over her, shaking her. He was a graying, slightly rotund  man with short, wide fingers that were now digging into her shoulder. His  vocabulary included a range of grunts she'd learned to interpret with great  accuracy. The one escaping him now was embarrassed frustration, but with a  slightly higher pitch than usual-aggravated, embarrassed frustration, she  decided, adding it to her catalogue. <br />
            <br />
            Kate knew that Bill Burke considered her hand-held &quot;snaps&quot; a  nuisance, not to mention the fact that his first wife would never have gotten  herself flat on her back in the middle of a public fairground. But Kate had  never promised ladylike decorum and, in general, doubted he had any notion what  he was getting into when he asked her to marry him. Thus his  ever-expanding range of non-verbal expressions. The  fact that she could amuse herself with that observation, served to assure her  that she was all right and not about to pass-out. Then, finally catching  her breath, she sat up.<br />
            <br />
            Bill grunted irritation, a second grunt of impatience; his fingers were  still dug into her shoulder. He reached around with his other arm to steady his  own camera atop a tripod. He had been using the open space of the fairgrounds  to pose a picture that recreated a scene from the recent Ghost Dance Uprising.  Nearby tents were being erected for a wild west show.  Both activities had attracted plenty of onlookers. Then several buffalo were  unloaded from a train causing a commotion. No, she thought, not the buffalo. It  was the Indian who'd caused the disturbance. Seeing the buffalo, one old Sioux  warrior had jumped to the top of the fence and then thrown himself around the  neck of the largest. <br />
            <br />
            Kate closed her eyes, remembering that, and heard the bustle of Sioux Falls in the  background-the noises of the coming age-the hum of the electric generator on  the opposite side of the river, the clack-clack of a trolley crossing the  bridge, a factory whistle. It might have given the impression of being settled,  almost urbane, if she hadn't known that only four months earlier the Ghost  Dance Uprising had ended with the death of three hundred Indians and twenty or  more soldiers at nearby Wounded Knee Creek. Now soldiers, Indians, reporters,  lawyers, photographers and interested individuals from all over the country had  converged for the trial of Plenty Horses-including this wild  west show complete with seventeen buffalo. <br />
            <br />
            The idea of trying Plenty Horses struck her as odd every time she paused  long enough to think about it. He'd killed an army officer. No one disputed  that fact. But why was that one killing deserving of formal justice and none of  the hundreds of others? she wondered. Obviously the  young Indian had crossed some fine legal line beyond her comprehension, but not  beyond interest. The trial had sparked national attention. <br />
            <br />
            Her dog, a large, red mongrel named Homer, pushed his nose into her face and  licked her chin. She opened her eyes and rubbed his neck in the spots she knew  he liked while waiting for the last of her dizziness to pass. He whimpered  little sounds of pleasure. <br />
            <br />
            Then her husband's fingers dug into her shoulder again, his hand caught her  under her arm. &quot;Get up,&quot; he told her. &quot;Get up. Soldiers are  coming.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            It wasn't &quot;soldiers&quot; who caused the tautness she recognized in his  voice. It was one particular soldier, Colonel Elliot George, an angular man  with thin lips, deep-set eyes, and a manner so commanding she'd known her  husband to break into a sweat just talking about him. The third time Bill said,  &quot;Come on, get up,&quot; she took his hand and pulled herself to her feet.  Just in time. Suddenly the Colonel and half a dozen soldiers rode up on  horseback, swirling a new cloud of dust across the fairgrounds. They  immediately took positions around the corral, their guns drawn. <br />
            <br />
            Kate turned and half-hunched her shoulders round her camera hoping to  protect it from some of the newly raised grit, and at the same time gave a  quick glance in the direction of the broken fence wondering about the Indian.  Several men were bent over his form as it lay just inside the corral. She hoped  he wasn't hurt too badly. All around the rest of the townsfolk were retreating  from the fairgrounds as the Colonel ordered the Indians &quot;rounded-up.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            That got Bill. He stomped in the Colonel's direction, one hand raised, as he  shouted to the man on horseback, &quot;Now how am I supposed to get my picture  if you send my Indians packing?&quot; Bill gestured at his camera and props. <br />
            <br />
            The Colonel turned his horse in a tight circle seemingly taking in the whole  situation for the first time. Then he barked back, &quot;Take it outside town.  This trial's enough trouble. We don't need more reasons to have Indians  wandering the streets of Sioux Falls.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            Any excuse to hassle Indians, Kate thought, but kept that thought to herself. She hadn't liked the Colonel from the first time  she met him. On that occasion, he'd barked back at Bill, &quot;She won't last  two weeks.&quot; He meant Kate, and she'd lasted all winter-stuck to it the  whole time Bill and the Colonel and his soldiers were out on the prairie  chasing ghost dancers. Not that she'd gotten any respect for that fortitude.  But she had gotten some fine photographs which is what mattered to her. <br />
            Suddenly Kate's thirteen-year-old Indian serving girl, named Mary by the  nuns at the reservation school, ran up and ducked behind Kate's skirts as if  she thought that would hide her from the Colonel and his soldiers. Kate handed  her a box of photographic plates that needed to be kept out of the dirt and  whispered, &quot;He doesn't mean you.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            The Colonel returned to his soldiering, barking orders left and right. Bill  swore quietly and then began packing his camera, other gear, and stage props.  No photograph today. His Indian subjects were being marched away, three mounted  soldiers at their rear. The soldiers he'd hired for his tableaux were now  scrambling to mount their own horses and join in executing the Colonel's  orders. Playacting one moment, drawing their guns for real the next, Kate  didn't pretend to understand things like that. She folded her camera, and was  pulling her cape over her shoulders when the Colonel swung around and halted  his horse directly in front of her. <br />
            <br />
    &quot;I'll have that picture.&quot; <br />
    <br />
    She was so startled, she wasn't sure what he meant.  Then the realization of it spread over her like a blush. Why? she wondered. He'd never shown an interest in any other  pictures she'd taken all the time she and Bill had traveled with him and his  Seventh Cavalry documenting events being called &quot;the end of Indian  wars.&quot; Why did he care now? It was just a silly picture of an Indian  hugging a buffalo, or at least she expected that was the way he would think of  it. <br />
    <br />
            His horse, heaving short breaths, was standing so close, she felt its edgy  energy and found it hard to raise her eyes from the animal to the man above.  When she did, she caught an unmistakable look of practiced arrogance. Colonel  George plainly enjoyed keeping the horse under him wide eyed and quivering in  nervous anticipation. He expected the same of her, a quick, quivering  compliance. What's more, that's all he cared about, she realized. The picture  meant nothing. He hadn't seen the way it had posed itself before her camera,  the action coming straight at her such that she'd likely stopped even the flip  of the Indian's hair. He just wanted to prove he could have it, the way he  could march Indians in any direction he decided. <br />
            <br />
            Kate tried feigned innocence. &quot;What picture?&quot; <br />
            <br />
    &quot;The one I hear you took of a fool Indian.&quot; <br />
    <br />
            Kate swallowed. How long had it been since a Sioux warrior had seen a live  buffalo? Ten years? Fifteen? To her way of thinking  that image captured more of this time and place than all the pictures her  husband had posed in the last eight months-another thought she didn't give  voice. In fact, she didn't give voice to any thought. She was too awash in  indignation to speak. <br />
            <br />
            The Colonel leaned over his saddle horn bringing his face closer to hers.  &quot;I don't think anyone needs a picture of a drunken Indian, do you?&quot; <br />
            <br />
            The Indian in her picture hadn't been drunk. She was sure of that. There'd  been too much knowing awe in his face as he hung to that shaggy beast, like  embracing an old friend. She gave another quick glance over her shoulder.  Several men were still bent over him. At least he wasn't dead. A body would  have simply been carried off by now. She was glad for that. She'd seen quite  enough of dead Indians lately. <br />
            <br />
            Then her husband nudged her from behind. &quot;Give him the plate.&quot; Of  course he wouldn't side with her. Bill's business dealings with the Colonel  included paying him a percentage of every photograph he sold in exchange for  the privilege of being allowed places off-limits to other photographers. Given  the interest this Ghost Dance Uprising had generated in the eastern press, that had proved a lucrative arrangement for both of  them. Trouble was, the Colonel could work out that same arrangement with most  any photographer, and there were plenty of them around. She considered all she  owed Bill. Not trouble. <br />
            <br />
    &quot;Give him the plate.&quot; Bill nudged her again. <br />
    <br />
    &quot;Yes, give me the plate,&quot; the Colonel repeated. He'd straightened  atop his horse and let a grin spread across his face. He thought he had her. <br />
    <br />
            Why didn't he ask her to pluck out an eye and hand it over? No big thing.  She had another eye. But he didn't have her. She knew what to do. Still she  hesitated. If the Colonel didn't know that her plateholder  held two plates, Bill did. Working the mechanism at the back of her camera, she  chanced it. She slid out the blank, not the picture, and offered it up. <br />
            <br />
            The rest happened quickly. The Colonel took the plate, broke it over his  knee, and tossed it back into the dust in front of her. Typical, she thought.  If there had been an image on that plate, it was ruined the moment it was  removed from her plateholder, but the Colonel was a  man who didn't stop at ruin. He ground things into the dust. <br />
            <br />
            The Indian girl bent and immediately began picking up the shards. Her dog  growled. The Colonel turned his horse, paused, as if he intended to say  something else, but didn't. He rode off instead. <br />
            She felt her husband relax. &quot;You know better than to take pictures of  Indians. Stick to your other pretties.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            She made no reply. Picking up her skirts and calling her dog, she stomped  off the fairgrounds. <br />
            <br />
            *** <br />
            <br />
            Bill Burke watched Kate leave with such a mix of fearful fondness his  stomach churned. She'd slipped the Colonel the wrong plate. He'd watched and  said nothing. He couldn't believe he'd allowed something like that. It was more  than foolish; it was dangerous, but that's how much he wanted to please Kate.  Not that it helped. No matter what he did, it was never enough to please that  woman. His silence hadn't pleased her, he knew. He supposed she had expected  him to speak up for her, confront the Colonel. She was that young. <br />
            <br />
            He felt his pockets looking for his roll of liver pills. He hadn't  experienced heart palpitations and stomach upset before marrying Kate. <br />
            <br />
            Looking up again, he caught the way she kicked her skirts out of her way as  she climbed aboard a trolley headed for town, her camera tucked under one arm,  her cape flapping off her other shoulder, her dog and Indian girl at her heel.  She was a short, small-boned bundle of energy topped with such a wild profusion  of curly red hair she somehow never looked entirely tidy. Didn't  matter. Anyone meeting her was immediately captured by her bright green  eyes and wry smile. He'd watched how people looked at her and then looked at  him wondering how they'd ever gotten together. Sometimes he caught himself  marveling at her laugh and his own good fortune. Then she'd do some fool thing  like almost letting a bull buffalo trample her. If that fence  had given away completely . . . <br />
            He found it was better not to think about things like that. Most of the time he felt like an oaf in her presence and tried not  to think about that either. He was too old for her. Old  and a bit too fleshy and a lot too dowdy. She was the daughter of his  longest and best friend. He'd literally watched her grow up, develop. He knew  damned well she'd have never married him if she hadn't needed to escape a bad  situation. He'd been familiar and conveniently available, that's all. <br />
            <br />
            He popped the pill and felt its bitterness sting his tongue before it  slipped down his throat. <br />
            <br />
            Somebody had to keep Kate's exuberance in bounds. She had no idea the  nastiness of this Indian business, for example. He couldn't let her meddle in  that, alienate the Colonel. He might as well slit his own throat, when it came  to his business. Nobody was going to respect him for doing that, not even Kate.  She, at least, understood the necessity of &quot;livelihood.&quot; He just  wished she didn't always force him to act more like a father than a husband. <br />
            <br />
            Bill popped a second pill and crushed the empty package in his left hand.  Since coming to Sioux Falls  he'd been going through three packages a week of these nasty liver pills. When  they were out on the prairie with the troops, Kate had mostly kept to herself, Then the only questions put to him were friendly gibes about  &quot;having his bride along.&quot; Nothing serious.  One look at her and every man out there knew why he &quot;wanted his bride  along.&quot; But since they came to Sioux    Falls, the Colonel had begun to question why she was  always taking pictures. He'd probably assumed she was amusing herself before.  Now it bothered him. &quot;Why doesn't she go shopping?&quot; the Colonel had  complained recently, &quot;like other wives?&quot; <br />
            <br />
            Bill shook his head. His father had warned him about &quot;expensive  women.&quot; His father had meant the kind who needed baubles and fine  clothes-the kind that had to &quot;go shopping.&quot; They were the worst, he'd  told Bill. &quot;Suck the life right out of you,&quot; his father used to say.  Bill tossed the pill wrapper into the dust. His father should have met Kate. A  woman with a passion was worse than the &quot;expensive kind.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            ***<br />
            <br />
            On the other side of town, Kate stepped off the trolley and straightened  the cape over her shoulder. Then she started up Phillips Street on her way to Tony  Amato's photography studio. To her annoyance, her dog kept up a chorus of  guttural noises as they moved along. He alternated those with rumbled warning  growls whenever someone on the boardwalk moved too close. She told him to  shush.<br />
            <br />
            She was already thinking how she would develop and print the plate of the  Indian and the buffalo. The problem was always how to hold the subtle spectrum  of grays. Contrast defined a photograph, but too much contrast resulted in  sooty shadows and chalky high values. <br />
            <br />
            Her dog was still growling. She tried shushing him again, but Homer wouldn't  be quieted. She looked around, saw nothing, continued.  She stopped, looked around, still saw nothing. The third time she repeated that  sequence, she saw the objects of Homer's unease-two Indian women working their  way up the street on the opposite side. <br />
            <br />
            She stopped and gave a glance to her girl, Mary, a young reservation child  who'd been to Catholic mission school but still dressed mostly native. She was  staring at the ground. Kate looked right and left and back to the trolley stop.  The women were obviously keeping Kate in sight. Had they been waiting for her,  knowing she frequently came to Amato's studio? <br />
            <br />
            Her dog growled lower, longer. <br />
            <br />
            She didn't understand the sudden rush of fear that gripped her except that  there were rumors everywhere. Rumors of remote hostilities,  secret ceremonies, other strange doings among the Indians that the Army hadn't  yet quelled despite their protestations to the opposite. The very air of  Sioux Falls  rustled with such tales as if belying the safety of a city with five railroads  and a new four-story hotel advertising a telephone in  every room. She shook herself. She wasn't going to be part of the local  paranoia. The town was in no danger. She'd been rubbing elbows with the  &quot;slayers of Custer&quot; for some time now, and, in her opinion, there had  never been any danger from them. This whole uprising wouldn't have amounted to  anything, if not for the Colonel. She'd watched him repeatedly turn a bit of  excitement into a full-blown confrontation, the way he had at the fairgrounds.  It made him a big man, kept his name in the newspapers. Of course, as her  husband was quick to point out, no one was asking her opinion, and supposedly  she didn't understand such things anyway. Indian troubles couldn't be allowed  to fester, no matter how seemingly inconsequential, he'd told her. <br />
            <br />
            At first, she'd considered the possibility that he might be right. She'd  never been &quot;west&quot; before coming with him. But after months of  watching the Colonel and his men, her unease had grown and broadened as a slow  widening arc of discomfort she couldn't quite name. There was something wrong  with all of it. Very wrong. <br />
            <br />
            <em>Lies,</em> she decided, slowly, quietly forming her own opinion as she  took her pictures and hid them away. It was all lies. And lies based on lies  that made it into the press and gotten believed. Needed justification for  sending in the soldiers, she knew, but couldn't condone. <br />
            <br />
            She was a photographer. She'd trained herself to see, and from what Kate had  observed. ghost dancing had never posed a threat to  anyone. It had been nothing but a strange religious hysteria-a messianic  movement that had swept through the tribes offering hope to the hopeless.  Diseased, defeated, hungry, and disillusioned by the government's failure to  keep its promises, proud nomadic peoples newly confined to reservations began  to believe they could dance their troubles away. <br />
            Believing in the visions of an Indian prophet who promised them a better  future, they had gathered in open spaces and drummed and danced and fasted  hoping to hasten the coming of those &quot;better days.&quot; Some feel into  trances and reported talking with their ancestors who, like the prophet,  promised them the buffalo would return. And the people believed and danced and  danced and danced until the local white population who equated all Indian  dancing with &quot;war dances,&quot; demanded that they stop, that the soldiers  come and &quot;subdue them.&quot; And the soldiers came and &quot;subdued&quot;  the Indians-many of them right into their graves. <br />
            <br />
            All that had happened because the Indians had danced until the  &quot;ghosts,&quot; their ancestors came and gave them comfort. Nothing more. But it was dangerous to speak that truth, Kate  knew. Almost no one did. <br />
            <br />
            Homer growled again. The Indian women now crossed the street, coming  directly toward her. She put her hand on Homer's collar and commanded him to be  still. His growl grew quieter, but not silent. <br />
            <br />
            The Indian women sidled around to Kate's side opposite her dog and  approached carefully. Both were wrapped in government issue  blankets draped over long calico skirts. Only the moccasins were traditional.  The younger woman's hair flowed over her shoulders in what appeared to Kate an  unruly mess. But her face was scrubbed, her cheeks highly colored, her eyes  dark and quick. More of the older woman's face showed, her hair having been  pulled back and braided. The skin around her mouth was lined. <br />
            <br />
            But when they got to Kate, they didn't stop. They passed by offering her a  beckoning gesture so slight she almost missed it. Then they stepped off the  boardwalk and disappeared into an alley. <br />
            Kate paused. She glanced around and thought twice about following them.  Contrary to her husband's most common complaint of her, she did use caution  sometimes. <br />
            <br />
            She took Mary's shoulder. &quot;Who are those women?&quot; <br />
            <br />
            The girl shrugged, said nothing. <br />
            <br />
            Kate glanced up and down the street again. Then she stepped into the alley. <br />
            <br />
            At first she didn't see the women. She continued down the passageway, past  the back entrance to a barber shop, past a coal chute and several garbage bins.  The light was dim from the closeness of the buildings. A cat started, hissed,  and scurried under a back step. Kate grabbed Homer before he could give chase.  Then hearing another noise, she whirled. <br />
            <br />
            They emerged from shadow and while still at arm's length, the older women  pulled a leather pocket pouch from between the folds of her skirt, unhooked it  from her belt, and extended it to Kate. She motioned a second time with a  gesture unmistakably meaning that Kate was to take the bag. She did. It was  about six inches square with decorative fringe and what Kate recognized as an  intricate quillwork design. This was a rare piece. Most Indian women had given  up the more difficult porcupine quillwork for stitching beads. She turned it  over. The back included a tuft of hair. Kate hoped it wasn't human. Kate had  always been short and slight. These Sioux women of the plains towered over her.  She looked up catching the shy glance of the older woman as well as the wide  brown eyes of the younger one. They nodded in unison and the younger said,  &quot;It's beautiful?&quot; <br />
            Kate nodded and again glanced at her hired girl hoping for some helpful  hint. She got none. <br />
    &quot;Woman-Who-Dreams makes it special for  you,&quot; the younger woman said in hushed, almost reverential tones. <br />
    <br />
            Kate let her eye follow the quilled  pattern-geometric lines, bands, bright colors. Engaging and subtle, yet  powerful in its ability to draw the eye deep and then deeper into the design.  Kate's head swirled again. For an instant she wondered if she'd been more  injured at the fairgrounds than she thought. <br />
            <br />
    &quot;Woman-Who-Dreams makes this special for  you,&quot; the older woman repeated. &quot;She knows you have Double-Woman in  you.&quot; <br />
    <br />
    &quot;Double-what?&quot; Kate looked up. <br />
    <br />
    The younger woman was now nodding vigorously while the older woman  continued, &quot;Those who know Double-Woman see her not only in the dreamtime,  but in the shadow the wind makes when it passes over the prairie. Grass and  Double-Woman know things. Important things.&quot; <br />
    <br />
    &quot;You will come to our camp?&quot; the younger woman now asked. <br />
    <br />
    Kate shook her head. What was this about? <br />
    <br />
    The older woman stepped closer. &quot;You are invited. It is an honored  invitation.&quot; <br />
    <br />
            That explanation was hardly enough to answer Kate's mounting confusion. <br />
            <br />
            The older woman fingered again between the folds of her skirt and pulled out  another pocket bag. Without removing it from her belt, she indicated the finely  worked design showing it to Kate. It was plainer, but still eye engaging. Now  the younger woman did the same, pulling out a pouch that hung from her belt and  showing it. <br />
            <br />
            Kate thought she understood. They wanted her to come to their camp and buy  handiwork from them. But she had no money. She said, &quot;It's beautiful, but  I'm afraid I can't.&quot; She offered the pouch back to them. <br />
            <br />
            The older woman shook her head slowly. &quot;It is made special for you, a  gift.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            Now Kate's confusion was complete. She couldn't imagine why these women  would want to give her such an item. It was valuable and there were at least a  dozen relic hunters in town willing to pay for it. What's more, it was common  knowledge that the government gave these Indians barely enough to eat, less  when there was trouble as now. <br />
            <br />
    &quot;It's beautiful,&quot; Kate repeated. &quot;But you cannot mean to give  it to me.&quot; <br />
    <br />
    &quot;Are you not the red-haired woman with the red dog?&quot; the younger  asked. <br />
    <br />
            Kate nodded. She could hardly deny the description. <br />
            <br />
    &quot;Then it is for you, and so is the invitation. Day after tomorrow, the  women who quill . . .&quot; she paused and again pulled her bag forward for  Kate to see. &quot;The women who quill,&quot; she repeated, &quot;wish you to  be their guest on the south side of Indian camp.&quot; <br />
    <br />
    Kate shook her head. Indian camp was a temporary cluster of teepees set up  at the edge of town to accommodate the Indians who'd come to Sioux Falls for  the trial, many of them witnesses who would be testifying, all of them guarded  by the Colonel's soldiers. <br />
    <br />
    &quot;Woman-Who-Dreams calls for you,&quot; the older woman intoned in a  voice deeply mellow. &quot;You must come.&quot; <br />
    <br />
    &quot;I can't,&quot; Kate said and again tried to return the quillwork. More  than the Colonel and his troops, a white woman, respectfully married, did not wander  out of town and into an Indian camp by herself, not if  she expected to come back with any decency left to her name. And since Kate  already lived at the edge of what was considered respectable for a woman, she  had even more reason to avoid this, or she just might find herself completely  outside polite society. It was a delicate balance she'd chosen for herself. <br />
    <br />
    &quot;I'm sorry, but I can't,&quot; she repeated. <br />
    <br />
            Homer growled. <br />
            <br />
            The two women stepped back, but still refused the quillwork. <br />
            <br />
            The younger woman looked to the dog, then back to Kate. &quot;You must come.  If you cannot come day after tomorrow, then please, you must come soon after  that. It is honored, important.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            Homer growled once more, and the women fled. <br />
            <br />
          Kate looked at the pocket bag again and shook her head. Then  she glanced up and down the alley to see who might have minded this strange  encounter and caught her hired girl, Mary, crossing herself.</p>

        <p><strong>Kate Burke</strong> is known as &quot;the red-haired woman with the red dog and the big camera.&quot; Focused on what she wants, she never blinks.</p>
        <p><strong>Bill Burke </strong>is a petty schemer and traveling photographer. He knows Kate married him only because he promised to take her West. </p>
        <p><strong>Colonel Elliot George </strong>is the hero who &quot;ended Indian wars forever.&quot; He will be the nation's  hero even if  he has to kill Mrs. Burke to cover up the gruesome truth.</p>
        <p><strong>Woman-Who-Dreams</strong> is the  last leader of the Sioux quillworkers, whose dream art is dying. Long ago she saw a vision of &quot;a red-haired woman with a red dog.&quot; She will need courage to entice Kate to her destiny.</p>
        <p><strong>Powers T. Nock </strong>is the odd but charismatic lawyer with the impossible case. His client, an Indian, shot an army officer in front of witness. He uses the trial to mount an assult on the nation's conscience and tops that with an assault on Kate's heart.</p>
        <p><strong>Richard Houston</strong>, the son of a wealthy eastern businessman, was inspired by Kate's father to became a photographer. Disappointing his own father. Kate has  an even better eye and no fear. He makes it his business to save her from the dangers she can't see.</p>
