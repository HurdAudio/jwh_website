        <h3 align="left">A New Generation of Storyslingers<br>
          Stake Out America's  Frontier<br>
          <br>
      <b>Rocky  Mountain News</b><br>
      <em><br>
      by Jerrie Hurd</em><br></h3>

              <p><br>
              As a kid, I did what everyone my age did. When I came home from school, I  flopped down in front of the television and watched westerns ­ <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/" target="_blank">Bonanza</a>,  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/" target="_blank">Gunsmoke</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Maverick</a></em>. It's embarrassing, but I'll confess that the power of  that visual medium was such that I began to think of the West the way it was  being presented in those series-as a place of strong men and few women. Never  mind that I was growing up on a working ranch in Idaho that included horses,  sheep, and three generations of women who had run that place since it was no  more than a hopeful claim in a raw wilderness.<br>
              <br>
              What's more this wasn't distant history for me. I knew all these women, even  my great-grandmother who first staked that claim and then went on to grow her  160 acre homestead into a sheep ranch that included all of Long's Valley. She  lived to be ninety-four years old. I was eleven when she died, and my  grandmother, who might best be described as &quot;Auntie Mame in boots&quot;  took over from her. My mother now runs the largest remaining piece of that ranch,  1500 acres, while my father, who died several years ago, had his own land and  held local political office. <br>
              <br>
              Books also didn't reflect the &quot;West&quot; I knew. <a href="http://www.louislamour.com/" target="_blank">Louis L'Amour</a>,  writing in the mythic tradition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Grey" target="_blank">Zane Grey, </a>continued a western storytelling  that had already proved successful with legend-hungry readers. In fact, his  success in writing westerns was so astonishing (his books still sell in the  millions) that for decades few publishers wanted to try anything else. As a  result, readers got book after book, followed by film after film about a  romanticized frontier that never existed. Actually that's not entirely correct.  A shoot-out at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfight_at_the_O.K._Corral" target="_blank">OK Corral</a> really happened. There was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_the_Kid" target="_blank">Billy the Kid</a> and a  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calamity_Jane" target="_blank">Calamity Jane</a>, but the men and women in my family and the larger ranching  community where I grew up built lives out of the drama of everyday decisions.  These were not lives that lacked excitement. It's just that the excitement  wasn't always focused at the end of a gun. L'Amour exaggerated as most writers  do in order to heighten the drama of a story. That's not the problem. The  problem is that he frequently chose to write variations on a single kind of  story ignoring other possibilities.<br>
              The bad news is a lot of people still think that's the only story this  region has to offer. The good news is that writers of a newer kind of western  are fleshing out the frontier with greater depth and understanding than ever  before.<br>
              <br>
              I'm not talking about historical revisionism or political correctness. This  is larger than discovering that women played broader roles than ranch wives or  prostitutes, and the fact that not every white male was a cowboy. It goes  beyond acknowledging that Asians and African-Americans had a large part in our  settlement story, or that Native Americans got a bum deal.<br>
              <br>
              It started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_McMurtry" target="_blank">Larry McMurtry</a> although he was not the first to get it  right, so to speak. Considerable credit needs to be paid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willa_Cather" target="_blank">Willa Cather</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Stegner">Wallace  Stegner,</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Stegner" target="_blank">Frank Waters</a>. Nevertheless, McMurtry's <em>Lonesome Dove</em>, which  won the Pulitzer Prize in 1985, is an undisputed watershed. But it didn't come  easy. Early in his career McMurtry is quoted as saying that Texas  themes and Texas  settings could be &quot;gravely injurious to a novelist's career.&quot; He was  referring to the hazard of writing about a region that had been reduced to  &quot;shoot-'em-ups,&quot; and therefore thought to lack literary legitimacy.<br>
              <br>
              In <em>Lonesome Dove</em>, McMurtry went back to original sources. Much of his  material is drawn from oral histories and a biography of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodnight" target="_blank">Charles Goodnight.</a>  Working from first-hand material, McMurtry delivers a fresh honesty, yet  doesn't debunk the more appealing myths, traditions and pride of the West. He  works hard to satisfy his audience's yearning for the familiar. That's what  legends are made of. The secret seems to be in the embellishment. McMurtry  presents misfits and backwater towns and odd details that keep his story from  slipping into a rut.<br>
              <br>
              This is the same thing Wallace Stegner did in his novel, <em>Angle of Repose</em>,  which is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Hallock_Foote" target="_blank">Mary Hallock Foote</a>'s diaries-the same thing a whole new  generation of western writers are doing with stories as diverse as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy" target="_blank">Cormac  McCarthy</a>'s <em>Blood Meridian</em> and Cindy Bonner's <em>Lily</em>.<br>
              But this newfound realism comes with a price: how to market such stories?  What do we call these decidedly different tales of the new Old West, and where  do booksellers shelve them? Larry McMurtry's publisher, Simon and Schuster,  insisted that Lonesome Dove was not a &quot;western.&quot; In fact almost  without exception publishers have jettisoned the term &quot;western.&quot; That  word is too strongly associated with the Zane Gray and Louis L'Amour and Hollywood films of the  50's and 60's. But no one has come up with a good substitute-&quot;frontier  fiction,&quot; &quot;western Americana,&quot;  &quot;novels of the West.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Publishers struggle with things as basic as book jackets. My publisher has  opted for filly covers for my tales of women in the West in an obvious attempt  to capture romance readers. <br>
              Ellen Recknor, author of <em>Me and the Boys</em>, has a different publisher  who has taken a different approach. Her book covers feature horses and sunsets  in an equally obvious attempt to capture western readers. Neither approach is  quite right.<br>
              <br>
              This is a struggle that will no doubt continue, mirroring the perplexity of  the world at large. Let's face it, we love the image of the Marlboro Man, but  are suddenly less sure about some of the things he stands for. We all know too  much about nicotine. We are too aware of the questions, right or wrong, about  the potential for overgrazing and desertification that go with raising cattle.  In other words, like it or not, our view of the American West has gotten  complicated. <br>
              <br>
              Is it too much to ask that our literature reflect that view?<br>
              <br>
              That's a question I wrestle with daily. I just finished a novel about a Lady  Pinkerton detective in 1880's Wyoming  (<em>The Lady Pinkerton Gets Her Man</em>), and I did my homework. I know that  the Pinkerton Detective Agency hired women agents as early as the Civil War and  several of these women, Kate Warne and Mattie Lawton, for example, became  famous. It's also true that there was an agency code of conduct for these  women. They were NOT expected to pack guns and certainly not supposed to give  the appearance of being &quot;loose.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              I guess I've grown up. I've learned what's real and what's fanciful. From  the beginning of this book, I wanted my Lady Pinkerton to be an exciting  western original-more like the women I grew up with than Calamity Jane. The  women I grew up with taught me how to push back my own frontiers in the broadest  most useful sense-they're the women I've always loved.<br>
              <br>
            Fortunately there are other writers who share my passion and a growing  audience for these new stories. In fact according to a study done by  Yankelovich Partners and reported in American Demographics (10/93) one in four US adults  describe themselves as &quot;western enthusiasts.&quot; That means there are  fifty-seven million Americans who are enthralled with everything from Santa Fe architecture to  the two-step. And that includes a good new western story.</p>

                  <p class="bookBlurb">When Jerrie Hurd writes a novel about real women of the Old West, you just  know it won't fit neatly into a mold. <br>
                      <br>
                    In her books, might isn't always right, the guy doesn't always get the girl  (or vice versa) and endings often reflect real life: They're ambiguous. <br>
                <br>
                    In her first two books, <em>Miss Ellie's Purple Sage Saloon</em> and  <em>Kate Burke Shoots the Old West,</em> her women characters were strong,  independent and far from perfect. Hurd doesn't detour much from that depiction  in her newest novel, &quot;The Lady Pinkerton Gets Her Man.&quot; <br>
                <br>
                    The Lady Pinkerton in question is Dayle Dobson,  who grew up in an orphanage and made a life for herself as a woman detective by  being tough. She smokes, drinks, bets on cock fights and (one suspects) hasn't  fought too hard to retain her &quot;virtue.&quot; <br>
                    She likes the freedom of being a Pinkerton, but sometimes gets herself into  trouble with her outspoken manner. <br>
                <br>
                    The book opens with a tense scene where she and two other women are rescuing  two young, reportedly reluctant prostitutes from the Tong, who rule the  Chinatown section of White Springs,   Wyo. <br>
                    But there are bigger goings-on in this town than sex slavery. The Anarchists  are purportedly trying to get miners to strike and shut down the nation's coal  supply, and thus its railroads. <br>
                <br>
                    Before it's over, Allan Pinkerton, himself, painted as an aging womanizer,  comes to White Springs. <br>
                    Dayle finds herself besotted by an actor who she  thinks is the leader of the Anarchists. <br>
                    And a rip-roaring getaway scene at the end is the stuff of which classic  Westerns are made. <br>
                <br>
                    Hurd skillfully paints a verbal portrait of a woman torn between her past  and her future, between reality and romance, between what's legal and what's  humane. <br>
                    Hurd is adept at creating a sense of place. In that opening scene, she  describes the Chinatown Dayle Dobson sees from her  rooftop perch: <br>
                <br>
                &quot;The scene was almost as dislocating as the height. In a quieter  moment, she might have entertained the romantic notion that she'd been whisked  away to some Cantonese village in old Cathay,  complete with the smell of herb shops and opium dens. She knew better. This was  the Chinatown of White Springs, Wyoming-a slaphappy collection of makeshift  shacks, lining a maze of narrow alleyways and tiny garden plots. The  structures, many of them two stories, had been thrown together from packing  crates and black building paper. The roofs had been tiled with flattened tin  cans.&quot; <br>
                <br>
                    Such detail takes research . . .
                    Her protagonist doesn't represent a romantic attempt at revisionist history.  There were Lady Pinkertons. The West drew many women  whose occupations or behavior would not have been accepted in the East. <br>
                    Hurd is drawn to those women and her stories about them, though fictional,  represent a neglected cast of characters who helped create the Old West.
