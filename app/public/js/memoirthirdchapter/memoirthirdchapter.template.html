          <p class="currentBlurbParagraph">Synopsis:<br>
            I travel to a remote corner of Arizona where an elderly aunt drives her pickup truck 80 miles an hour over questionable roads while regaling me with one family story after another. My aunt, who doesn’t travel in anyone’s slow lane, usually has no patience for nonsense. She surprises me with a new family love story—one I’d never heard—but also returns again and again to the tale of a climbing snake. I finally get it. Nonsense stories are never about climbing snakes. They are about something deeper. My aunt saves me from my too-serious self and sets me up to appreciate a much broader range of family stories—a fabric, not a timeline.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <h3><b>Never Doubt A Climbing Snake</b></h3>
          <p class="currentBlurbParagraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live a thousand miles from home. And I’ve only recently given family stories more than a second thought. Cherie Karo Swartz, on the other hand, has spent twenty-five years teaching people how to record their histories. Her Saturday seminar at my local library seems like a no-brainer. I’m hoping she has a step-by-step outline for my project or a clear idea on how and where to start.<br><br>
          In the class, I learn that her own storytelling tradition goes back five hundred years to a famous Rabbi, known for the <em>malech</em>, or angel, that sat on his shoulder and whispered stories to him. Her grandmother, her <em>bubbe</em>, used to say, “Sit down, let me tell you a story, and make you a part of the family.” Swartz believes family is story. Everything else is dust or soon will be. I like her attitude.<br><br>
          As part of her workshop, she hands me a page of prompts. I’m supposed to pick one or two and start writing whatever comes to mind, just let it flow.<br><br>
          A remembered smell . . .<br><br><br></p>
          <div class="subP"><em>First time I smell tiger lilies, I am visiting an elderly friend of my mother’s who had a row of them growing along her driveway. Besides the smell, I am stunned by the brightness of the orange color.<br><br>
          I want my mother to notice the flowers, but she is busy, doing adult things, I don’t remember what. I am six-years-old and might as well be living in a different universe.<br><br>
          The lady notices. She makes my mother wait while she puts some bulbs in a box for me. I keep the bulbs for years, tucked in a safe place, believing they are precious, but having no idea how to turn them into flowers.</em></div><br><br><br>
          <p class="currentBlurbParagraph">A place with fond memories . . .</p> <br><br><br>
          <div class="subP"><em>I loved going to my grandmother’s house. Not because she made cookies or any of the usual reasons. I liked her house because it was beautifully decorated. Sometimes I sat on the edge of her couch and studied her things being careful never to touch or disturb anything. At the same time, even as a child, I knew my grandmother’s house was the subject of family gossip because it was so beautifully decorated. The family gossips whispered that she spent too much of my grandfather’s money on silly things. She was trying to be uppity and maybe thought she was better than everyone else with all her fancy stuff. Blah, blah, blah . . .<br><br>
          As I’m writing this, I’m feeling confused. My grandmother died recently and her furnishings look ordinary, almost shabby, in my mother’s house.</em></div><br><br><br>
          <p class="currentBlurbParagraph">I stop writing—something I’m not supposed to do, according to the rules of the exercise, but it just hit me . . ..</p><br><br><br>
          <div class="subP"><em>My grandmother wasn’t a spendthrift; she was an artist, probably a frustrated artist. She took ordinary things and made them stylish.</em></div><br><br><br>
          <p class="currentBlurbParagraph">The exercises prove fun and more enlightening than I’d expected. Later, we go round the table sharing our stories. We have some touching moments and some good laughs. Nevertheless I’m feeling increasingly frustrated. I want to do more than write down the stories. I want to understand the grip those stories have on me. After class, try to ask my questions but Swartz has other places to be and no time for my more complicated issues. Instead, she invites me to her home where we can talk at greater length. <br><br>
          She lives in an area of Denver that is unfamiliar to me. I have trouble finding her place and arrive late. No problem, she assures me, and then immediately begins fussing in the kitchen. She is a professional storyteller who believes we need stories more than food. Nevertheless, she must fix tea and find some honey cake to sweeten the talk. She’s a generous hostess, but I also realize she’s nervous—not sure about my questions or me. So I start simple. I ask about families that don’t have a strong storytelling tradition.<br><br>
	        She shakes her head. “Oh, there’s never a last storyteller,” she assures me. “Someone is always told the stories, because we can’t live without our stories.”<br><br>
	        I tell her about a Native American blessing ceremony I attended where more than half the people were white. The elder, a friend of mine, whispered, “What? Have they forgotten to listen to their own old ones?” He assumed that the non-natives were borrowing his ceremony-rich tradition because they don’t think they had one of their own—or had forgotten it. <br><br>
          He’s not comfortable with that. Nevertheless he goes out of his way to make the strangers welcome because, like Swartz, he believes we can’t live without stories. Later, he tells me that forgetting the old ways is bad for a person. Very bad. He believes that without stories a person can become physically ill. For that reason, he won’t deny someone who is seeking. “Besides,” he adds with a sly wink, “sharing a story with a stranger is like counting coup. If the stranger is touched by your story, he will see the world through your eyes.”<br><br>
          Swartz listens, nods, but is hung up on the part about not having a storytelling tradition. “Story is anchor, heartbeat, everything that’s family,” she tells me. “And the stories go on forever. There are stories upon stories, no end of stories. If you don’t know your own tradition you need to ask.”<br><br>
          That’s exactly what I’m trying to do, but I want to get past the cute stories. I want the deeper ones. If there are endless stories, I want to know why my family picks particular ones and insists on telling those stories, not others. Certain stories define who we are largely because we tell those stories over and over—like my family’s love stories. I want to do more than re-tell or record those stories. I want to understand those stories.<br><br>
          Swartz balks at the idea that families deliberately choose the stories they tell. She wants me to believe it’s the other way around. “We hear the stories we need,” she tells me. “Any story that doesn’t fit a personal need will roll off our backs like water off a rain slicker.” I think that might be true of casual, everyday stories, but if you are one of the “White Horse Nielsens” and have heard the grandma-stops-the-railroad story a hundred and three times, I suspect it has soaked-in.<br><br><br>
          I have a friend who is into silent meditation. She attends ten-day retreats and tells me that silent practice is about getting beyond words, beyond stories. “You are not your story. If you are the daughter of an alcoholic father (her story), you need to grow out of that story, because you are more than that story.” Rather than dig up the old stories, she suggests meditation is the answer. She would have me shed the stories that are holding me back like getting rid of too much stuff or too much ego.<br><br><br>

          Another friend, who has been a psychotherapist for thirty years, thinks people can get stuck in their stories because they seem familiar, become a crutch, or because they just believe that’s what happened and so that’s who they are.<br><br>
          “Do they ever get unstuck?” I ask one morning over coffee.<br><br>
          “It takes an ah-ha moment,” she explains. “They talk themselves into a corner or something happens and suddenly they see things in a new light.”<br><br>
          “OK, but what keeps them from just slipping back into old habits?”<br><br>
          She looks at me like I haven’t been listening. “When you’ve had an ah-ha moment, there’s no going back. You’ve seen. You know. It’s all different.”<br><br><br>

	        After I share those conversations, Swartz seems to understand. “Ah, yes,” she says. Then she tells me about the mother who chased her daughter up the stairs insisting she listen to a story the daughter didn’t want to hear. Swartz calls these shut-the-door stories, as when someone in the family decides that a story must be told a certain way and shuts the door, so to speak, and says, “This is how it will be.” She explains, however, that those core stories are not material for a beginning workshop or pretty much any workshop she is interested in teaching. She isn’t prepared to take her students into the deeper layers. That, she warns me, ought to be left to professionals, like my friend with thirty years of experience in psychotherapy.<br><br>
          Not what I wanted to hear.<br><br><br>
          Later that week, I am having dinner with friends and repeat Swartz’s story of the famous Rabbi and his <em>malech</em> because I think it’s a good one. A physician sitting at the end of the table comments, “We have meds for that now, you know.” And just like that, he reduces a 500-year-old family tradition to a delusion.<br><br>
          Also, not what I wanted to hear.<br><br><br>
          Personally, I prefer to think that a 500-year-old <em>malech</em>, delusional or not, has stood the test of time. Too much truth doesn’t explain why that family clings to that story. It’s clearly important to them. Swartz began her class by saying, “I am descended from a famous rabbi known for his <em>malech</em> or angel.” Clearly I’d failed to explain my interest in family stories to that physician in a way that embraced that <em>malech</em>—made him real to the family and the storyteller who introduces herself that way.<br><br>
          At the same time, I was beginning to appreciate how little family stories rate. Laugh them off. Leave them alone. Meditate them away. Let medical doctors or other professionals take care of them. No reason to dig around in something as boring as how Uncle Henry survived the snowstorm of ’48. Or waste time listening to Aunt Susie complain about how much better things used to be.<br><br>
          Oh, please, give me a <em>malech</em> to spice things up!<br><br>
          Nevertheless, I’m still haunted by my family and their love stories.<br><br>
          Lacking an easy guideline, I decide to start asking questions of the only people who are likely to know anything—my family. With that in mind, I phone my mother’s older sister—my aunt Laura. She’s the most down-to-earth, no-nonsense person in family. I assume, when it comes to family matters, I can count on her to give me the straight scoop. After a little preliminary chitchat, she invites me to her Arizona house for the weekend. And wouldn’t you know it, when I arrive, she greets me at her backdoor with a nonsense story about a climbing snake. <br><br><br>

          “It wiggled up and around the window where you’ll be sleeping tonight,” she tells me, then waits to see how I’ll react. I shrug. I’m a generation younger, but Laura and I both grew up on the same ranch where bunkhouse brag includes all kinds of fantastical stories of snakes, horses, coyotes, and other animals.<br><br>
          “A bird beat it back,” she goes on. “It was quite a fight. You should have been here last week. That was something to see.”<br><br>
          Birds have been known to attack and even eat snakes, eagles for example, but she points to a nest tucked under the eave of her house. The size of the nest does not suggest we are talking about eagles.<br><br>
          “That bird was protecting her babies,” Laura continues, “and she wouldn’t give up and wouldn’t give up and wouldn’t give up. After awhile, you had to admire the way she wouldn’t give up. She beat the snake back. One minute it was a fight to the death. The next it was like that snake couldn’t get out of there fast enough.”<br><br>
          I glance again at the nest. Laura, my mother’s older sister, lives on a hay ranch in the extreme southeastern corner of Arizona—a place so remote she drives fifty miles to buy groceries, a hundred and fifty miles to see a doctor. If climbing snakes exist, this is where they live. I would give her that.<br><br><br>

          “Turkey Creek’s running,” she told me, earlier when I phoned from the motel where I stayed the night before. “You won’t get through that way, unless you’ve got four-wheel drive.”<br><br>
	        I don’t.<br><br>
          “Then you’d better come round the long way,” she advised.<br><br><br>

          Laura, more than anyone else in her generation, embraced it all—every wild and wilder aspect of being a real citizen of the American West. Just before hanging up, she adds, “You’re going to get dirty.” That was ranch talk. She was telling me that my car would be the same color as the dirt road by the time I got to her place. The dust would be that thick, which, when I think about it, is why I’m making the trip. If anyone can help me sort out the saga of our shared history, it is Aunt Laura. For one thing she still cares about the depth of the dust. For another, she is a master of our family’s style of storytelling—exaggerated, larger-than-life, over-the top. Think climbing snake.<br><br><br>

          When I was growing up, Laura and her husband, Lloyd, owned a livestock trucking company that operated out of Billings, Montana. “We’re bullshippers,” she used to say because “livestock haulers” wasn’t colorful enough.<br><br>
          Her husband kept the trucks on the road. She handled the payroll and the paperwork. Truckers are the new cowboys—fiercely independent loners, who crisscross the open spaces of the American West, driving their rigs to the tune of country western songs playing on their radios. No accident that Laura transfers our storytelling style to her trucking tales.<br><br><br>

          One time a team of drivers are coming down a long hill in a truck loaded with cattle when the brakes give out. This is before highway departments started adding escape ramps. With no way to stop, the drivers face a nasty choice. They can drive the truck off the side of the road, or try to keep it under control long enough to eventually roll it to a stop. In this case, the second option means riding at high speed through a small mountain town where they know there they will encounter people, traffic, and stop lights. Chances are someone will get hurt, maybe killed. They opt to drive off the road, jumping out at the last possible moment before the truck goes over the edge. Fortunately the drivers escape with minor injuries. Unfortunately the truck is totaled, and the cattle all die.<br><br>
          Next day, Laura gets a call from the National Park Service wanting to know what she is going to do about the mess. The truck had come to rest just inside Glacier National Park. Rules state she has to remove the wreck or bury it. Since pulling the wreck off that steep slope isn’t an option, she hires a bulldozer operator, tells him to bury everything and thinks that is the end of a bad episode.<br><br>
          Two days later, the Park Service calls again. This time they want to know what she is going to do about the grizzly bears. Seems they sniffed out the wreck, dug up the beef, and are having a feast—lots of them. Worse, they have become a traffic hazard as people stop to watch. Not one to be intimidated, Laura points out that the bulldozer operator, who buried the wreck, had been leery about working on that steep slope. He is going to be even more hesitant about the bears. As far as she is concerned, she has met the Park Service’s requirements. The grizzlies are their problem.<br><br>
          That’s where Laura usually ends the story, but, if you ask, she’ll tell you that for three weeks the grizzlies ate what they could dig up and then moved on before the “bureaucrats”—her term for the Park Service—could figure out a solution.<br><br><br>

          She also tells about a time when one of her trucks, loaded with hogs, broke down on a highway crossing an Indian reservation. This is before mobile phones, so the driver leaves the truck and hitches a ride to the nearest town. When he gets back with a tow, the hogs are gone. Laura speculates that news of a load of hogs, sitting on the side of the road, spread like wildfire across the reservation. Free meat! Ham and bacon this winter! When she tells this story, she never begrudges the locals who took her pigs. She knows life in that part of rural America is hard and sometimes hungry, especially on that particular reservation. Her problem is the insurance. She can collect if she has dead pigs, even sick pigs, but not when she has no pigs. “Try paying for a whole truck load of hogs,” she says at the end of this story. “That’ll eat your lunch.”<br><br><br>

          As with most families today, mine is scattered over great distances. Thanks to modern communication we stay in touch, but stories, like Laura’s grizzly bear picnic and the disappearing hogs are more than staying in touch. I’d heard the stories before. Hearing them again is like eating comfort food and nobody, including me, wants the family food traditions questioned never mind that our idea of turkey stuffing is mostly wet toast seasoned with butter and onions. Stories, I decided, are the same. Don’t ask too many questions. Listen. Take your time. Time, I discover, is key. If you want the good stuff, you have to hang around long enough to let it surface. Stories need to breathe. I’d driven several hundred miles and planned to stay three days.<br><br>
          Laura is always happy to have visitors but not impressed with the purpose of my current stay. As soon as we got past the climbing snake, she tries to brush me off. “You can leave me out of whatever it is that you’re doing,” she says. “I’m not the family storyteller. I’m too busy. You should know that.”<br><br>
          I make no promises, as I follow her into her kitchen.<br><br>
	        “I’m not sure what you want, anyway,” she goes on.<br><br>
	        “The stories,” I repeat. We’ve been over this on the phone.<br><br>
          She grunts. “Who wants to relive the past? I’ve got better things to do. Haven’t you?” I shrug and less than two minutes later, she sits at her kitchen table and tells me the story that everyone in our family always tells. “Your great grandmother Sophia stopped a whole railroad, you know.”<br><br>
	        I know, but want to hear her tell it.<br><br>
          Laura emphasizes how young Sophia was, when she ran away and got her railroad job. “It was a hard way to begin life, but she had bigger things in mind,” Laura tells me “She always had bigger things in mind. She was thinking and scheming and doing big things, even when she was older than I am now.” Laura was in her seventh decade. Sophia lived to be ninety-three.<br><br>
          Laura pauses and shakes her head. “It helps to think beyond today’s problems, you know, especially if you’re going to leave home at fourteen years of age with nothing but the clothes on your back. Ask me, that’s why, when it got down to a fight between her and that railroad, she couldn’t lose. For one thing, she had nothing to lose. As bargaining positions go, that one’s not bad.”<br><br>
          “And it makes a great love story,” I add because that’s the way I’ve always heard it.<br><br>
          Laura suddenly stiffens. “Sophia could never match her mother’s love story.”<br><br>
          “Her mother? I thought her mother encouraged her to run away and get that railroad job. I thought her mother was afraid her father would beat her to death if she didn’t.”<br><br>
          “Stepfather,” Laura corrects me. “Her real daddy died too young. It’s what happens to all the good ones, if you want my opinion.”<br><br>
          That last phrase refers to more than Laura actually says.<br><br>
          <img id="snake1" src="./img/climbSnake1.jpg">
          Laura is a tallish woman with auburn coloring—older now, but still striking in appearance. Better yet, she is and always has been self-assured; some say to a fault. In other words, Laura gives as good as she gets, which is at the core of her own love story. She and her husband, Lloyd, were not only well matched; they were even-matched. Think Benedick and Beatrice in Shakespeare’s <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>. The fact that they never, ever stopped sparring, didn’t keep them from being a couple—so much a couple that, within the family, we are in the habit of saying “Laura-and-Lloyd” like it is a single name. <br><br>
          Unfortunately, he died of a sudden, fatal heart attack a few months before my visit, which explains her reference to “the good ones dying too young.” They’d managed to match wits to the very end. Story is they even debated whether or not he was having a heart attack. He didn’t think so. She wanted to call 911. The discussion was short. He died before she could make the call.<br><br><br>

          “I can’t believe that you never heard about Sophia’s mother,” Laura continues. “It’s a good story—a shipboard love story that could be straight out of a romance novel.”<br><br>
          She gets us some cold drinks from the refrigerator, sits down, gets up again, and looks for some crackers. “Her name was Anna Metta Jensen,” she says, rummaging in her cupboard. “We used to call her Grandma Jensen because her second husband, the bad one, was also surnamed Jensen. She ended up with the same surname as she started with—a variation on women keeping their names, I suppose. That’s trendy these days, you know.”<br><br>
          I nod.<br><br>
          She finds several boxes of crackers, and brings them all to the table, in case I like one more than another.<br><br>
          “That’s getting ahead of the story,” she pauses to reorder her thoughts. “Anna Metta and her parents were on a ship coming to America from Denmark. Only conditions on those immigrant ships weren’t the best, and this particular one had been at sea longer than usual. That’s a polite way of saying it stunk,” she tells me as she sits back down.<br><br>
          “That’s what happens when you don’t find favorable winds. Things start to stink,” she says with emphasis. Laura can be tough, even intimidating, but say what you will, she has never sat around waiting for favorable winds. She created opportunities. Besides the trucking company, Laura and her husband owned a ranch in Montana that specialized in raising buffalo long before Ted Turner and his chain of Montana Grills made buffalo burgers trendy.<br><br>
          She continues.<br><br>
          “Anyway, Anna Metta was in the habit of going up on deck as often as she could to get fresh air and to freshen up. One day, she was washing her face when the soap slipped out of her hands. She lunged for it. If she lost it, she had no way to replace it. So, there she was, on her hands and knees, chasing a bar of soap across the slippery deck when a young man stepped forward and retrieved it for her. Of course, he helped her to her feet. He was ten years her senior, traveling with two younger brothers. He immediately apologized for the brothers. They’d been laughing at her and her soap-chasing plight. Then he sent the younger boys below deck and introduced himself as John Holm.<br><br>
          Laura pronounces it “Hol-em” with two distinct syllables. I’ve heard the name before—it’s Sophia’s maiden name—always pronounced that way. Laura puzzles a moment and admits she doesn’t know why we say it that way. Then she goes on to explain that most Danes are named after their fathers’ first names. They are called Jensen or Johnsen or Iversen—literally the son of Jens or John or Iver—the name changing with each generation. Holm is different. It is the name of landed people who took their name from their family holdings. Or, at least, they’d once been landed people. She adds that John Holm wouldn’t have been on that ship if his fortunes had been much better than Anna Metta’s or her family.<br><br>
          I nod and encourage Laura to continue.<br><br>
          She says, “After they landed in New York, Anna Metta and her family took a train to St. Joe, then rode a riverboat to Florence, Nebraska, where they outfitted themselves with oxen and wagons for the trip west. Problem was, Anna Metta’s father spoke no English. He had to point to words in his English-Danish Bible in order to make himself understood, so, of course, the local traders took advantage of him. The oxen, he bought, were young stock, not completely broken to harness. They tipped the wagon over, more than once, before settling into the long overland journey.”<br><br>
          Laura smiles. “Guess what Anna Metta did during that long trip west?”<br><br>
          I shake my head.<br><br>
          “She walked beside her parent’s wagon, nearly the whole way. John joined her, whenever he wasn’t looking after his brothers. That means Anna Metta and her beau walked a thousand miles together—a thousand miles,” Laura repeats. “Some courtship, don’t you think?”<br><br>
          I agree.<br><br>
          “At Fort Laramie, where the wagon train stopped for additional supplies, Anna Metta married John. She moved her things from her parents’ wagon to his wagon and thus began her married life.”<br><br>
          It is a good story. Too good. I am waiting for the entrance of the mean stepfather. “Then what happened?” I ask.<br><br>
          “One of John’s brothers died—one of those younger ruffians who kept teasing John and Anna Metta. He was devastated. He blamed himself.”<br><br>
          “What else?”<br><br>
          “They settled on some land in Utah Territory, and started a family—five children. Sophia was their second child. When Sophia was barely past being a baby, six years old, her father was kicked in the chest by a horse. The injury turned to consumption. He knew he was dying, but he kept working anyway, hoping to leave his family something to live on after he was gone.<br><br>
          “One day he was working on a fence when his neighbor rode by and sneered at his efforts. ‘Don’t know why you’re working so hard,’ he said. ‘I’ll get it all when you’re gone—your wife, too.’<br><br>
          “John warned Anna Metta not to have anything to do with that man, and she tried to avoid him. After John died, she hired a man to help her, but he wasn’t dependable. He abandoned the farm and her family—an option she didn’t have. Without the farm, she had no way to feed her family. So eventually she married the neighbor, but it was never a happy union. That stepfather is the reason Sophia ended up working for the railroad, scrapping for her money. She knew what happened when a woman ran out of options.” Laura sat back. “Now there’s a love story with both a good and bad ending. How about that?”<br><br><br>

          I’m glad I made the trip. I’ve heard another love story. According to Laura, it’s the love story that started the tradition. And I still have most of the weekend ahead.<br><br><br>

          Next morning, over coffee, Laura returns to her climbing snake. “He’s still around here. I see him from time to time. <em>On the ground</em>,” she emphasizes. “You don’t need to worry about him. He stays on the ground now.”<br><br>
          I’m not worried about her climbing snake. However, I know that there were members of the family who were worried about her. Current family wisdom centers on the idea that, Laura ought to move “closer in.” Any emergency, like her husband’s heart attack, would find her far from medical help—too far. Never mind that her younger daughter, currently away for the day is living with her. Laura, of course, has other ideas. She wants to show me around. We pack a lunch and head out.<br><br>
          “Bet you never had a snake try to get up under your roof,” Laura adds, as she opens the door of her pickup.<br><br>
          <em>That snake again</em>.<br><br>
          She whistles for her dog. It jumps in and claims a spot on the seat between us. Laura chuckles, “<em>She’s a good dog, but she’s no Fannie</em>”—a family expression I immediately recognize. We’ve been comparing our dogs to the legendary “Fannie” for as long as I can remember. A little later, riding along at eighty miles an hour (Laura doesn’t drive in anybody’s slow lane), I realize the story of Fannie is likely a continuation of the story Laura finished last night.<br><br>
          “Fannie was Anna Metta’s dog,” I say.<br><br>
          “Yeah, it was her baby girl they thought the Indians stole.”<br><br>
          She assumes I know the rest. I do.<br><br><br>

          Shortly after they settled in the American West, Anna Metta sits her first child, a daughter, down while she finishes a chore. A moment later, when she looks around, the baby is gone. Fearing the worst, she begins a panicked search. At the same time, she screams for her husband—the first one—the good one.<br><br>
          The two of them quickly discuss whether or not they have seen any Indians hanging around. They don’t think so, but they aren’t sure. Still new to the frontier, they rely on what they’ve been told are the local dangers, mainly Indians. Mainly horrible stories about Indians stealing babies like theirs.<br><br>
	        Half an hour later, when their search has reached a fever pitch of desperation, the husband notices that the family dog is also missing. He whistles for her. The dog, named Fannie, barks but won’t come. Following Fannie’s barks, Anna Metta and her husband find the baby sleeping under a large bush near a dry streambed. She’d toddled off and then fallen asleep in the shade, while the family dog faithfully stood guard. Or that’s how we tell the story a hundred and fifty years later.<br><br>
          Here’s where things get tangled. Recent scholarship has determined that Native Americans were not in the habit of stealing white children. Occasionally that happened, not often. More to the point, it was never reported in the area where my family lived. Those fears were largely the result of sensationalized stories over-reported in that day’s tabloid press and passed on to every new settler. Before Indians, it was gypsies who supposedly stole children.<br><br>
          Without much effort, I can imagine families, like mine, telling stories like that one, since the beginning of time. We misjudge the real hazards but know we need good dogs, like Fannie, to help us keep watch. If we could find another dog “as faithful as Fannie,” my family says, again and again, never mind that the underlying fear is exaggerated at best, prejudicial at worst.<br><br>
          What, I ask myself, am I going to do with stories like that?<br><br><br>

          Meanwhile, having arrived on the far side her ranch, Laura gazes across the landscape and returns to her climbing snake. “It never had a chance against that bird,” she tells me. “That bird wasn’t going to quit and let it have her babies. You got to admire that. That’s real bravery”<br><br>
          What am I going to do it with that snake story?<br><br><br>

          To change the subject, I ask Laura if she remembers our trip to Disneyland. When I was growing up, every kid, I knew, wanted to go to Disneyland mostly because Walt Disney had a regular TV program that frequently featured his theme park. However, no one from my part of Idaho had actually been there. That is, until my aunt Laura, put her three kids into her car, left Montana, stopped in Idaho to pick me up, and off we went. At the time, that was the biggest adventure of my life. Only now do I sense how really extraordinary it was. In the 1950s, few women set off, like that, with four children and miles and miles to go alone. Her husband was busy keeping their trucks on the road. I tell her I think she was brave.<br><br>
          “Brave? I must have been crazy. You kids fought every mile of the way.”<br><br>
          I don’t remember that. I remember being the envy of every kid in my school that fall. I’d actually been to the Magic Kingdom.<br><br><br>

          Stories of family vacations are boring—still are. That said, much, much later, after I’ve talked to lots of other family members and am close to finishing this project, I realize there is another curious dimension to Laura’s Disneyland adventure. Consciously or unconsciously, she recreated an earlier family trip. The earlier trip happened in the 1930s—a long time ago—but in interview after interview I keep hearing about that 1930s trip. The second, third and fourth times I hear the story of that California trip; I think, <em>oh, no, not that again</em>.  The fifth time, I go back and re-read my notes from the previous interviews, trying to understand what it is about that particular trip that had left such a lasting impression on so many lives.<br><br>
          Here’s what I’ve pieced together.<br><br>
          For years, my grandma Melba had been telling, her husband, my grandpa Irvin that she wanted to go to California. She had the kids working on him. “Please, please, can we go to California?” they’d all learned to repeat on cue. Then one day, in the middle of winter, he came home and said they’d go, but only if they could be ready by morning. Everyone started to scramble, except Marjorie, Laura and my mother’s same-age cousin who lived next door. She sat down and started to cry.<br><br>
          She wanted to go, too!<br><br>
          At first my grandfather told her that there were too many people for the car, but she kept crying. Worse, Laura and her sisters started crying. They wanted Marjorie to come. She was like another sister. Finally, grandfather relented. Next day, they stopped at a hardware store and bought a stool that they placed between the seats for Donna, the youngest sister, to sit on. That way, Marjorie could go.<br><br>
          When Marjorie told me about the trip, she emphasized how lonely she would have been if she’d been left behind. When Donna told me the story, she emphasized, with obvious pride, how, as the youngest, she sat on that wooden stool all the way to California and back so that Marjorie, the oldest, could come. Young Irvin, the only boy, sat in the front with his parents because he was always causing trouble. Everyone agrees on that fact.<br><br>
          <img id="snake2" src="./img/climbSnake2.jpg">
          On their way to California, the family stayed the first night with relatives, who explained that they didn’t need the bedding they’d packed. Roadside cabins provided bedding. They unpacked their blankets, which, fortunately, created more room in the car, and left their blankets on the relative’s back porch. Then they continued on. Evidently, in the late 1930s, even a family of some privilege had not traveled enough to know about motels—a detail I found interesting. And, possibly, that’s what made the trip so important. It was a real adventure. More like Marco Polo setting off for fabled places than current family vacations.<br><br>
	        Of course, it's also possible that the trip was on everyone's mind because young Irvin, the little troublemaker who sat in the front seat, had recently died in a fiery, mid-winter highway accident on his way to another vacation. However, that does not explain why twenty years later, my aunt Laura piled her kids in her car and set off for California to see Disneyland, re-creating the earlier trip, right down to including a close cousin—me, instead of Marjorie.<br><br><br>

          After I piece it together, I call and ask Laura if she is aware of the similarities of the two trips.<br><br>
          “Have you seen the pictures?” she asks.<br><br>
          I had, but don’t get her point.<br><br>
          “In every picture, we’re wearing our heavy winter coats,” she explains. “It’s like we drove all the way to California and never noticed the sunshine. When you and I went, I told your mother to pack plenty of shorts and sandals.”<br><br>
          That’s another way the truth of our stories eludes us. We get lost in the details and miss the bigger patterns like how often we repeat—relive—events from our family’s past. If we do that while planning a vacation, is it a large leap to assume we might also do that when we’re making some of our larger decisions in life?<br><br><br>

          When we return to the house that afternoon, Laura’s daughter, Linda, is there, having arrived with supplies and three carpenters. She is remodeling the little house in back of Laura’s bigger house. Almost every ranch I know has a big house and a little house. The little house is always older—the original home of the first settlers. The big house comes later, after they’ve prospered. In this case, the little house was an old stone structure—very sturdy—but it hadn’t been lived in for decades. Remodeling it was a major undertaking.<br><br>
          Laura, who hadn’t said much about her daughter until now, seemingly couldn’t contain herself. “I lived in the same house with the same man for half a century. Two women can’t make it under the same roof for half a year.” Then sensing that she’d said too much, she retreats into her kitchen.<br><br>
          Linda, who heard everything but knew enough to ignore the moment, waits until the back door slams. Then, without commenting on the outburst, she invites me to look around her project, no halfway endeavor. By whatever means she and her mother had arrived at this solution, once they’d decided what to do, they’d obviously decided to do it right—new plumbing, new wiring, new floors, new windows. And style. Adobe finish on the outside. Window casements that accentuate the thick rock walls on the inside. Open beams in the ceiling. There is a sense of excitement as Linda tells me her plans. Only at the end does she add, “I have a great mother, but I need my space if I’m going to keep thinking of her that way.”<br><br>
          I have nothing to add to that.<br><br>
          Later, when Linda and I go inside, Laura looks up from where she is chopping vegetables and says, “She already knows about the climbing snake.”<br><br>
          Linda rolls her eyes.<br><br>
          “I told her all about it and the bird,” Laura continues.<br><br>
          “How about the javelina pigs?” Linda asks.<br><br>
          “The javelina pigs?”<br><br>
          “Yeah, they’re at least as good as the climbing snake.”<br><br>
          “I don’t agree,” Laura says. She stops chopping and stirs in the drawer of a nearby desk. When she finds it, she hands me a photograph of two wild javelina pigs crossing her front lawn. “The pigs are almost as good as the climbing snake,” she continues tossing the words in Linda’s direction. “Almost. Not quite.” Then from the same drawer, she produces more photos, pictures of the snake crawling up and around the guest room window, the snake battling the bird, the snake retreating from the roof.<br><br><br>

          That story is true!<br><br>
          <img id="snake3" src="./img/climbSnake3.jpg">
          It takes me a moment to absorb the pictures. Then I realize the snake story is more than true; it’s truth. I get it. I don’t know why it took me so long. My aunt Laura lives on the wild edge of life—always has. From the moment I arrived she has been trying to tell me that she still lives there. She has snakes climbing her walls and javelina pigs cavorting on her lawn. What’s more, she has the photographs to prove it.<br><br>
          I got distracted. I think I’ve come to Arizona to gather stories, but, in fact, the last thing my mother said to me was that she wanted a “full report,” meaning an assessment of how Laura is doing. “I don’t know why she doesn’t move into town,” my mother says, expressing the family sentiment.<br><br>
          I know why. Town is too tame. That is not to say that Laura is conscious of why she keeps telling me about the climbing snake. More like she is anxious about her situation, and what I’ll make of it. Every time that anxiety rises to the surface, she remembers the climbing snake, and tells me about it again  . . . and again . . . and again.<br><br><br>

          I am going to have to apologize to Cherie Karo Swartz. She’s right. We tell the stories that we need. And unless we listen carefully, we may only hear the stories that we want to hear. Looking back, I think I may have annoyed her with my intensity. I was going to get to the guts of my family’s stories. No climbing snakes for me. No embarrassing moments. Don’t bother me with boring 1930s vacations. Wow, was I wrong. Below the surface, the funny, nonsensical, climbing snake stories can be as important as the epic train-stopping ones. Figuring that out is a major first step.<br><br><br>

          Next morning, I notice that none of Laura’s neighbors pass her place without stopping. Her routine includes getting up early, making coffee, and putting biscuits in the toaster-oven. From dawn ‘til noon she runs a regular deep-in-the-desert Starbucks. She has more people go through her kitchen in a morning than I have in a month.<br><br>
          And what do these people do while they drink her coffee?<br><br>
          Mostly they tell stories.<br><br>
          With one exception.<br><br>
          One of her morning guests, a rancher from the next mile over, shows up with a cell phone in his shirt pocket, a pager on his belt, and a laptop in his hand. He is as wired as any caffeine-based urban-type and about as laconic as any sheepherder who’s been out in the hills too long. I mention that because Laura is called outside, leaving the two of us in an awkward silence.<br><br>
          To break the tension, I ask, “You heard about Laura’s climbing snake?”<br><br>
	        “That would that be the one she’s always talking about?”<br><br>
	        I nod.<br><br>
	        “Not anything special round here,” he adds. “Got lots of snakes.”<br><br>
	        He’s speaking literally. As a story, that climbing snake is a whole other animal.<br><br><br>

          According to one of the oldest storytelling traditions, there is a Bone Woman who spends her days gathering the neglected bits that others leave behind. She takes them to her cave, piles them high, and, when the time is right, usually during a long winter night when the moon is full, she sings them back to life. Every family has a Bone Woman. Or several. The trick is to get her to talk.<br><br>
          Here are some simple rules:<br><br>
          If she tells you a story, assume it’s important.<br><br>
          Never doubt a climbing snake, or any other seeming nonsense, because stories are not about climbing snakes; they’re about deeper things.<br><br>
          Listen, listen, and listen harder because it’s really easy to miss the good stuff.<br><br>
          If she offers a variation of an old familiar story, puzzle out what’s changed. What did the Bone Woman think needed to be adapted to current circumstances?<br><br>
          Don’t get lost in the details; the larger patterns are what matter. Look for patterns.<br><br><br>

          And when the Bone Woman says, “I’ve got better things to do. Haven’t you,” the appropriate response is a shrug. That’s a test. She wants to know if you’re serious. When it comes to family stories most people aren’t.  I am. Wasn’t at first, I am now.
