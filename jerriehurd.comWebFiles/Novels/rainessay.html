      <em><span class="style4">by Jerrie Hurd</span></em><br />
    </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Street,  Silverton, Colorado, goes nowhere.&nbsp; You  have to find Highway 550 to get out of town.&nbsp;  A lot of people have.&nbsp; According  to Sheriff Sue Kurtz, the population of her county has dwindled to less than  six hundred and continues to drop.<br />
        <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the  Monday afternoon when I sat in her office, she was the only law officer on duty  in &ldquo;at least a four hundred square mile area,&rdquo; maybe more, depending on where  the neighboring sheriff happened to be patrolling that day.&nbsp; It was quiet.&nbsp;  The phone only rang once the whole time.&nbsp;  She was preparing for court the next morning, working her way through a  stack of files, and complaining about people who couldn&rsquo;t take &ldquo;the altitude.&rdquo; Her entire county is higher than 8,000 feet.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fear of high  mountain passes&rdquo; was what she blamed for keeping her part of America from  prospering.&nbsp; &ldquo;We had this guy once.&nbsp; I thought he was having a heart attack.&nbsp; Turns out he was hyperventilating.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d gotten himself over one high pass and  then realized there was no way out of here without going over another one, just  as bad.&nbsp; One of my deputies had to drive  him out.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where was  he from?&rdquo; I asked, just making conversation.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Some place  flat,&rdquo; she said with enough tone to keep me from asking about flatlanders  again.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheriff Sue  Kurtz likes where she lives and works.&nbsp;  Nevertheless, San Juan County, Colorado, has a lot of &ldquo;altitude.&rdquo;&nbsp; Silverton, the county seat, is nine thousand  three hundred feet high, and things go up from there.&nbsp; No place for the fainthearted.&nbsp; After awhile I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that  might include me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d called and  cancelled our interview the previous Friday when the pass in question required  chains.&nbsp; Her dispatcher wanted to argue  the point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll be OK if you&rsquo;ve  got a four-wheel drive or good snow tires.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I drive a two-seater&mdash;a sporty  model that doesn&rsquo;t even haul groceries.&nbsp;  When Sheriff Kurtz and I walked out of the courthouse together, she  spotted it immediately.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t  belong.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; I explained.&nbsp; She shrugged in a way that made it clear that  she had about as much use for that frill as a flatlander sucking too much of  her rarified air.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her air is so  rarified she may have forgotten how normal people live.&nbsp; Did I mention that I had to wait on the  highway for a crew to clear avalanche debris ahead of me?&nbsp; That was on a good day, when there were no  travel restrictions.&nbsp; Did I mention that  Sheriff Kurtz puts on a bulletproof vest and an avalanche beeper every morning  before she goes to work?&nbsp; &ldquo;I have to  assume that everyone in my county is armed,&rdquo; she explained.&nbsp; Turns out that it&rsquo;s been a long time since  she&rsquo;s been in an actual shoot-out, but she thinks the avalanche beeper will  save her life someday.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there  women sheriffs in the American West like Samantha Nielsen, the main character in <em>Rainbow Horses</em>?<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there is Sue Kurtz.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was the  only woman, at the time I did the research for this novel, but the problems that make the job of an elected  sheriff in the modern West challenging are not necessarily gender related.&nbsp; I asked if I could &ldquo;ride along&rdquo; with Sheriff  Gary Amon in Idaho.&nbsp; A &ldquo;ride-along&rdquo; is a  fairly common request from a journalist who wants to ride in a patrol car with  an officer in order to experience a &ldquo;typical day&rdquo; on the job.&nbsp; Sheriff Amon&rsquo;s &ldquo;ride-along&rdquo; was anything but  typical.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the  highway in front of his courthouse as a runway, we took off in a Cessna 206,  flying.&nbsp; That was after he showed me  photographs of the wreck he&rsquo;d walked away from and after his deputy, the pilot,  showed me his dog&rsquo;s pilot&rsquo;s license.&nbsp; The  joke was on the licensing agency.&nbsp; The  license was legit, and &ldquo;Corky,&rdquo; the dog, jumped in the plane like it was the  back of a pickup and rode along, sometimes in the co-pilot&rsquo;s seat.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highway   used for take-off was the main road, but nobody seemed too worried about  stopping traffic.&nbsp; Murphy, the county  seat of Owyhee County, has a population of fifty, including the inmates in Sheriff Amon&rsquo;s jail,  and like Silverton, Colorado, the main road through town doesn&rsquo;t really go  anywhere.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the weather&rsquo;s good and if  the creeks aren&rsquo;t running and if you have four-wheel drive and if you&rsquo;ve also  got good clearance, then you might make it all the way to Jordan Valley,  Oregon, where you can pick up the highway again,&rdquo; the sheriff explained.&nbsp; A lot of &ldquo;ifs.&rdquo;&nbsp; In reality the road was paved for a few  miles, graded for a few more miles and impassible after that.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we were in the air.&nbsp; Sheriff Amon has patrol cars, all of them  with four-wheel drive and high clearances, but even specially equipped, they&rsquo;re  limited in the area they can cover and the time it takes to cover that area. <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in the  air, we cruised up narrow canyons looking for marijuana fields.&nbsp; We dipped down over ranches where we  delivered a restraining order.&nbsp; We  climbed higher into the mountains looking for big horn sheep and the  international poachers who prey on them.&nbsp;  All the while, Sheriff Amon told me about his problems with meth-labs, a  recent gang-related killing, and the people from Boise who drive into the  middle of the desert to blow their heads off.&nbsp;  &ldquo;We get the messy ones,&rdquo; he said, matter-of-factly.&nbsp; Turns out that also applied to highway  crashes.&nbsp; Nobody drove the long, lonesome  stretches across his county at anything close to the speed limit.&nbsp; But if you get lost there, chances are good  that he can find you.&nbsp; He was proud of  his search and rescue volunteers.&nbsp; That  included their dogs and their horses and their &ldquo;moms&rdquo; who made coffee and  sandwiches.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in a  place where he had to use a hand-held GPS in order to get a fix, we found the  poachers we&rsquo;d been looking for&mdash;wealthy Japanese taking trophy big horn  sheep.&nbsp; They had two planes and a camp on  the ground and something else that someone quickly covered with a tarp.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moments  earlier, the sheriff and his deputy had been buzzing herds of antelope for me,  showing off.&nbsp; Now this was serious.&nbsp; Sheriff Amon radioed Boise.&nbsp; We circled.&nbsp;  He needed the numbers off the planes and discussed with his deputy, the  pilot, how low they could pass over the planes on the ground, considering the  high-powered rifles they&rsquo;d spotted and the safety of their passenger&mdash;me!&nbsp; His plane wasn&rsquo;t identified as being &quot;law enforcement.&quot; They bantered  whether or not  they should get their plane marked someday.&nbsp;  They wondered whether that would &ldquo;help&rdquo; or make them a &ldquo;bigger  target.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this situation turned &ldquo;ugly,&rdquo;  they had no backup.&nbsp; In fact, Sheriff  Amon took that moment to explain to me that all the men in his office patrolled  alone, knowing that if they got into trouble, backup was hours away. <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheriff  Amon&rsquo;s county is larger than the state of Massachusetts, populated by less than  seven thousand people, and honeycombed with canyonlands&mdash;deep, narrow slits that  represent an uniquely young geology, as landscapes go.&nbsp; That fact was impressed upon me by a  &ldquo;world-famous&rdquo; geologist.&nbsp; I met in a  bar, next day, in a place called Jarbridge.&nbsp; Several  people had told me that I needed to talk to him.&nbsp; Every one of them had described him as  &ldquo;world-famous,&rdquo; almost as if that description was a part of his name.&nbsp; I never found out what earned him that  respect.&nbsp; The night I talked to him, he  was too drunk for details, so he worked on the one fact he thought I ought to  know, namely that the canyonlands around us were only twelve thousand years  old.&nbsp; He compared that to places in  Australia, where he&rsquo;d worked recently, and where there were exposed rocks  thought to be seven or eight billion years old.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The twelve  thousand years that have passed since the catastrophic volcanic explosion that  covered that area and land as far away as Nebraska was less than a tick on the  geologic clock, a mere flicker of time.&nbsp;  We were sitting in a bar in a canyon sandwiched between sheer rock walls  that were only a flicker old.&nbsp; Did I  understand that?&nbsp; Could I wrap my mind  around the difference between that and a billion years?&nbsp; It was a sobering thought, but not sobering  enough to help him. <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How I got  to the bar and that evening is another story.&nbsp;  I wanted to meet Janet Ocrowley and a dentist from Mountain Home, Idaho,  who&rsquo;d been instrumental in keeping those canyonlands from becoming a military  bombing range.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d also been involved  in several other local environmental issues including an effort to make the  entire plateau and its canyons a national park, something on the scale of an  American Serengeti.&nbsp; Janet gave me a  bumper sticker that reads:&nbsp; Visit Owyhee  National Park.&nbsp; I loved the idea of  sporting a souvenir on my car from a place that didn&rsquo;t really exist, but I knew  the sight of that bumper sticker would anger the local ranchers, and I needed  to talk to some of them as well.&nbsp; Land-use  is a heated debate all over the American West, and not something that&rsquo;s likely  to be resolved any time soon mostly because there is a lot of emotion attached to the subject.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to  Janet Ocrowley.&nbsp; I agreed to come to her  for the interview, knowing that wasn&rsquo;t simple.&nbsp;  Janet lived in a place called Hot Springs, population 12, that wasn&rsquo;t on  any map I had.&nbsp; Not an unusual set of  circumstances.&nbsp; There are roads and other  &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; all over the American West that pre-date the US Forest Service  but that have never been acknowledged as &ldquo;official&rdquo; by that agency.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s  another source of friction, out West.&nbsp; In  fact, shortly after I visited Janet, the Forest Service tried to close one of  those &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; but unofficial roads and sparked the &ldquo;Jarbridge Shovel  Rebellion,&rdquo; an uprising that made the New York Times repeatedly throughout the  fall of 1999 and the spring of 2000.&nbsp; At  the height of that grassroots rebellion, ranchers, miners, loggers, and  small-business owners across twenty western states gathered more than 9,000  shovels, which they paraded in the streets of Elko, Nevada, in support of  efforts to rebuild that road, by hand, using those shovels, if necessary.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happens  that was the road Janet Ocrowley lived on.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you live  in a place that&rsquo;s not on the map, you need to give your visitors careful  instructions.&nbsp; Janet&rsquo;s went something  like this:&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop at the Bruneau Caf&eacute; and  ask for the Three Creek Road. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a  dirt highway.&nbsp; Go south on the Three  Creek for about seventy-three miles.&nbsp;  There will be a fork in the road.&nbsp;  Keep right.&nbsp; At the top of the  canyon, turn again . . ..&rdquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t  remember the rest.&nbsp; It got more complicated&mdash;something  about bridges and canyon entrances and a place where I needed to be careful  that I didn&rsquo;t drive off the road, especially if it was dark.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was well  after dark on a Saturday night when I arrived.&nbsp;  The dentist was to meet us the next morning.&nbsp; Janet greeted me at the door, bag over her  shoulder, coat in her hand.&nbsp; She wanted  to go to the big Saturday night dinner at the bar in Jarbridge, another fifteen  miles down the canyon over the disputed road.&nbsp;  We took her car because she &ldquo;knew the road,&rdquo; meaning she knew where all  the washes were.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we  finally arrived in Jarbridge, there were at least fifty people already in the  bar.&nbsp; I have no idea where they all came  from, but the place was hopping&mdash;music, food, dancing, drinking, a minor  altercation going on in the street.&nbsp; We  had trouble finding a place to park where we wouldn&rsquo;t block the canyon.&nbsp; When we got to the front door, we were met by  a waitress, who asked if we had reservations.&nbsp;<br /> 
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not  making this up.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t  have reservations.&nbsp; That meant we would  have to wait twenty minutes to be seated and the prime rib was already  gone.&nbsp; It was chicken or pork chops or  nothing for us.&nbsp; Sometime later, I sat  down to a chicken and gravy supper and that discussion about &quot;billions of  years&rdquo; with the famous geologist.<br />
<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even later,  people in the bar began telling Coyote stories&mdash;an old western tradition.&nbsp; In Jarbridge they liked Coyote stories where  the Old Trickster made fools of the Feds&mdash;particularly Forest Service  employees.&nbsp; It was as though they  anticipated the coming trouble.&nbsp; More  like, to them, it was on-going.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old Indian idea  that colored horses guard the various directions,  are less  well known than Coyote stories.&nbsp;  Likewise, few people know where to find pictographs of horses, but if  you know where to look, they&rsquo;re there.&nbsp;  On the other hand, almost everyone has an opinion about wild  horses.&nbsp; People, like those in the bar at  Jarbridge, like to tell about the times when they&rsquo;ve caught glimpses of wild  horses.&nbsp; In many ways wild horses have  become symbolic of the larger, more complex problems of the modern West.&nbsp; Lots of folks love wild horses and love  seeing them, but nobody knows what to do about them, which means they&rsquo;ll  probably be gone soon.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night  I slept on a cushion on the floor of Janet Ocrowley&rsquo;s cabin.&nbsp; There are no motels in Owyhee County,  Idaho.&nbsp; Remember, it&rsquo;s an area the size  of Massachusetts.&nbsp; When I asked Sheriff  Amon to recommend a place where I might stay the night before I was to  interview him, he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bring a  sleeping bag,&rdquo; he told me.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No tourist  traps for as far as the eye can see.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No tourists  either.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought  that might be a problem the night I used my sleeping bag at the Idaho  Hotel.&nbsp; The Idaho Hotel is an over-sized,  grand, old Victorian lady standing at the center of the largest ghost town in  America&mdash;a place with over seventy abandoned buildings.&nbsp; At least, that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s described on the  postcards you buy in Boise.&nbsp; The same  postcards purchased in the hotel lobby have &ldquo;ghost town&rdquo; crossed out.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s five residents take umbrage at being  called &ldquo;ghosts.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed runs the  hotel.&nbsp; He and his three partners are  trying to restore the place.&nbsp; Never mind  that it&rsquo;s way, way off any beaten track.&nbsp;  Never mind that Ed&rsquo;s rigged up a heating system, consisting of  wood-burning stoves and interlocking chimneys, that&rsquo;s likely to burn it  down&mdash;sooner, rather than later.&nbsp; Ed seems  to sense that.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I got no  insurance,&rdquo; he told me when I went to check in.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Something happens, you&rsquo;re on your own.&rdquo;&nbsp;  In fact, he made me sign a waiver.&nbsp;  Then he gave me a tour.&nbsp; The love  and labor he and his partners have put into the place is mind-boggling.&nbsp; The day I was there, they were trying to jack  and brace the building back into an upright alignment, a quarter inch at a  time.&nbsp; The whole hotel leaned toward the  creek noticeably.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That  evening we all sat outside on the second floor veranda, listening to the  building groan under the pressure of the braces, and watched the stars come  out.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are spots on the Owyhee  desert that are so remote there&rsquo;s no artificial light at all,&rdquo; Ed told me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should see the stars there.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave without visiting the five  cemeteries,&rdquo; someone else suggested.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Five?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; Turns out there  was one for Jews, one for Chinese, one for Masons, one for Catholics and one  for everybody else who used to mine the mines over a hundred years ago.&nbsp; &ldquo;God forbid that the wrong bones should mix,&rdquo;  someone commented.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Ed got  going about the bad habits of snowmobilers, who were his only winter  trade.&nbsp; They showed up, sat around his  stoves, muddied his floors, ate the snacks he sold, and complained.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when I decided the lack of tourist  traffic probably wasn&rsquo;t the problem I&rsquo;d thought it was.&nbsp; Ed doesn&rsquo;t like tourists.&nbsp; He happier when they don&rsquo;t show up.&nbsp; Never mind that he needs paying customers to keep his hotel going--if that's the correct expression. I leaned over the rail and placed some of the  clearest cell phone calls of my trip and then went to bed without a light.&nbsp; A suite at the Idaho Hotel comes complete  with no running water and no electricity.&nbsp;<br /> 
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the  people and the places depicted in this novel real?&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.&nbsp; <em>Rainbow Horses</em> is a work of fiction&mdash;a product of  my imagination.&nbsp; Drinkwater County, for  example, is a made-up name for a made-up place, a composite of several places,  some of which exist only in my head.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,  the modern West is real enough.&nbsp; You can  still find places &ldquo;out there&rdquo; that are so remote they seem older than cowboys,  older than old Hollywood movies, places that are probably best described as  Native Americans have always described them, as Old Man Coyote&rsquo;s Country&mdash;tricky  terrain.&nbsp; You can go there if you&rsquo;re  willing to dispense with the usual expectations.&nbsp;That is also what makes those places perfect for fiction. They're already a bit beyond the real.</p>
