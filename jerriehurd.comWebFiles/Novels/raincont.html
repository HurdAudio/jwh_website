    <td rowspan="4" valign="top"><p><a name="more" id="more"></a>“They shipped horses from here all the way to South Africa for the Boer War?” he asked again.<br />
        <em>At least he’d heard of the Boer War,</em> she thought with some relief. “Actually, I think they shipped them to Nebraska to a British procurement agent who then shipped them to South Africa,” she said. “There’s a book about it in the local library.”<br />
“He’s not interested in horses or history,” Willoughby growled from under the hood.<br />
She glanced at Miles for confirmation of that. <br />
He shrugged, a gesture that wasn’t as rich as his voice.<br />
“What is your interest?” she asked.<br />
Willoughby stuck his head out from under the hood. “He’s here to make a movie. I’ve explained that we’re in the middle of a modern-day range war. Lots of drama. Epic stuff.”<br />
Again she glanced at Miles<br />
Again he shrugged.<br />
&nbsp;“You remember the Gurwitt brothers?” Willoughby asked.<br />
She didn’t. She was too young. However, she knew the name. Around Drinkwater, the name Gurwitt was pronounced with the same inflection as a swear word.<br />
“These are the younger Gurwitt brothers,” Willoughby continued.<br />
She found that more than surprising. After shooting their last big-screen western here, twenty or more likely thirty years ago, the older Gurwitt brothers had skipped town without paying their bills. People in Drinkwater still remembered. <br />
“Everything that’s wrong with this country is related to our current lack of big-screen westerns,” Willoughby went on. “I’m talking about the kind of movie that once clearly defined this nation. Heroic stories with good guys and bad guys. You know, the kind of movie where when things go wrong somebody does something.”<br />
Sam had no comment, or nothing she cared to say out loud. If this was one of Willoughby’s westerns, she suspected she had just been cast in the role of the do-nothing. At the same time, she couldn’t help noting that Miles similarly offered no comment. Even more telling was the way his brother skipped the subject altogether.<br />
“Actually, we’re half-brothers,” Simon told her, as if that was the topic of discussion.<br />
Miles shook his head.<br />
Simon lowered his camera long enough to give a nod in Miles’s direction. “His problem is that he doesn’t want to believe our mother was a slut.”<br />
At that, Miles rolled his eyes the way only an older brother can.<br />
Sam was having trouble deciding which was the more ridiculous—Willoughby thinking the world could be saved by cinema or these two with their brother/half brother eye-rolling routine. The worst of it was that having had the half-brother possibility pointed out, she couldn’t help noticing that Miles and Simon shared little resemblance. Nor were they close in age. Miles, she guessed, was her age, mid-thirties. Simon was ten years younger.<br />
Willoughby closed the hood of her truck. “Everything looks fine.”<br />
She thanked him.<br />
“Where you headed?” he asked as he straightened his back and then handed her the notebook from his front shirt pocket, an old backcountry tradition. <br />
She took the notebook, but hesitated to answer the question, knowing that was guaranteed to irritate. “I’m on my way to check on those students doing research up by Summer Creek,” she said. “Nobody’s heard from them in a couple of days.”<br />
Willoughby snorted. “They’re probably shacked up in some motel with a couple of showgirls from Reno and don’t want to be found.”<br />
She saw no reason to argue. That was how a lot of these things turned out. At the same time, she opened his notebook and flipped through the pages. Every rancher had one of these that was routinely offered for her inspection—a tradition, that went back a hundred years, related to cattle rustling, which, to this day, was a crime more likely committed by a neighbor than a stranger. Recorded in the notebook would be the time, place and license number of every vehicle Willoughby had encountered for as far back as the notebook went, usually several months. If she needed to go back farther, the notebooks were never thrown out. In other words, this was a place with a diary and lots of eyes. Almost nothing happened in Drinkwater without somebody taking note. She hadn’t been on the job long when she realized that flipping through ranchers’ notebooks allowed her to keep a running mental picture of everything from the routine to the unusual. In this case, she noticed that Willoughby had seen the bird-researching students going south a couple of times. The university was north so were the usual sources of supply. Of course, Reno was south. <br />
&nbsp;“Let the buzzards have them,” Willoughby continued, partly because he was still showing off and partly because he really did hate university types. “If they’re so hot to study birds, let ‘em study the birds that’ll eat their eyes out, if they get the chance.” <br />
She handed the notebook back. She needed to go. The university students’ last reported location was still ten miles away. Even if she found them and they were fine, it would be mid-afternoon before she got back to town and her office where a million other things awaited her attention. <br />
Willoughby wasn’t finished ranting. “Nobody walks away from this one,” he told her. Now coming around to the current crisis—the one he thought had cinematic possibilities. “That includes our esteemed Congressman. I’m told he hasn’t officially taken a position. Is that right?”<br />
Sam shrugged. The Congressman was her father, but he didn’t exactly consult with her. She was a baby when her parents split. Nevertheless, she was willing to give Willoughby credit for trying. These days, they were all grasping at straws—hoping for an act of Congress, if not an act of God. She glanced again at the younger Gurwitt brothers. Enlisting Hollywood, at least, was original.<br />
Her dead husband seemed to agree. His current tune was a mocking counterpoint to Willoughby’s complaints that suddenly slipped into an achingly beautiful melody done in parallel harmonies—his way of acknowledging that the situation was serious. It would likely be the ruin of a lot of good people. Worse, there wasn’t much she or Willoughby or anyone else could do. The whole thing was in the hands of a federal judge who had never set foot in Drinkwater. Maybe that was good. Her husband had come once and hated the place. However, since she returned, his music had become more knowing, as if he’d come to understand the place. He’d scored this scene perfectly. Maybe there was hope for the judge as well. She paused long enough to give herself a little shake, trying to keep focused, which was sometimes a problem when she was the only one who could hear the music. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>That’s when Miles recognized her. He’d seen her on television—the evening news—about a week ago. He might have remembered right away, but he tended to think like an actor, meaning he could remember a gesture long after everything else faded. In this case, he remembered seeing her shake herself, like that. It was a small, almost imperceptible movement, but a telling gesture—something one does to clear the head. He’d watched her do it, a week ago, and wondered what she was thinking. She then went on to face down an irate federal bureaucrat with perfect poise. <br />
        The bureaucrat had eight beef cows grazing on the lawn of his vacation home. Cattle grazing in an upscale ski resort was the kind of oddity currently deemed ratings-worthy by the national media. They were all over the story, feeding it to their satellites, using it as teaser, repeating it through the news cycle.&nbsp; He’d even seen a mention of it on one of the Comedy Channel’s fake news programs. No doubt it had also been&nbsp; pirated onto YouTube and downloaded a zillion times.&nbsp; <br />
        The cows were on that lawn to protest something, he couldn’t remember what. He did remember that the bureaucrat wasn’t amused and wanted the cows removed. He also wanted the perpetrator of that prank, the sheriff’s grandmother, arrested. The news anchor of the show Miles happened to be watching had made much of this young law officer, from the backwoods of Idaho, being asked to arrest her own grandmother. It was the kind of human interest bit that newscasters tended to deliver with a chuckle, whether or not there was some underlying seriousness. <br />
        By contrast, Sheriff Sam Nielsen had stood in the glare of the national media, unflinching, except for that little shake, and calmly explained that she wouldn’t be taking anyone into custody, not even the cows. Idaho was an open range state. If the bureaucrat wanted to keep livestock off his lawn, he was required to fence them out, not the other way round.<br />
        You couldn’t make up stuff that good. <br />
        No doubt that was why the scene had stuck in his head, every detail, right down to the definition of “open range.” That’s also why, if there was a story here, he suspected it was hers, not Willoughby’s. <br />
        “Mind if my brother and I ride along with you for awhile?” he asked.<br />
        She seemed startled by the request.<br />
        Willoughby was more than startled. He didn’t like the idea. “Trust me, you don’t want to talk to the university-types on her itinerary,” he said, like he’d forgotten she was standing there. <br />
        Willoughby wasn’t hard to figure. The old guy’s cowboy view of the world didn’t include lady sheriffs. She bothered him. He wasn’t sure how to act around her, which was the real reason he’d spent so much time under the hood of her truck. Miles understood the feeling. His own stereotype of a gun-toting law-woman was a lot more butch. <br />
        Willoughby didn’t know when to quit. “Those damned bird-lovers are about as exciting as watching grass grow. All they do is sit around and count birds. Not the kind of action that will make a modern western. Ask you uncle.”<br />
        Miles didn’t know what to say to that. She didn’t need to say anything to indicate what she thought of Willoughby. Simon was filming. Nothing new. Simon lived behind his camera and often had no idea what was really going on, until later when he cut the images together. <br />
        Then before Miles could comment, she added her own objection. “He’s right. You’d be disappointed. I won’t be scaring up any wild horses.”<br />
        Miles was from an industry where there was only one rule: get the movie made. No other rules. No questions asked. Since Miles wanted his uncle to bankroll his and Simon’s next project, he was happy to do whatever, including check out the local scene. However, from the moment he met Willoughby, none of this made sense. At least the sheriff was interesting.<br />
        “We’ve already done wild horses,” he told her. Then turning to Willoughby, he added, “For a broader perspective, half a day with the local law makes perfect sense, don’t you agree?”<br />
        Willoughby sputtered a couple of lame objections that Miles shrugged off. <br />
        The way Sam saw it; there was a bigger problem. Miles’ too-wide smile might be a Hollywood asset, but, out here, it would more likely invite trouble, as in “wipe that smile off your face” or “what you got to smile about?” The bigger problem was that he and his smile were out-of-place—too out-of-place for her to ignore. She knew why Willoughby considered him a prize, but she couldn’t figure why he thought being in this wilderness was worth his while. In short, she was the sheriff, and she needed to know what he was doing here. <br />
        She gestured for the brothers to get in her truck.<br />
        If she wanted to be truthful, she would admit that Willoughby’s continued agitation was what finally decided it. Any day she could annoy that old boy was a good day. <br />
        Of course, once the brothers were in her truck and they were on their way, she wasn’t sure what to do with them. She worked alone. She had three deputies, a dispatcher, and a jailer. They all worked alone. There was too much ground to cover in a place as big as Drinkwater for the luxury of partnering up. <br />
        What’s more, she’d never been any good as a tourist guide. Drinkwater was a place you had to learn to love. Second best was to develop a sense of humor. The owner of the local Texaco station had gone the humor route. Along with gas, oil, and tires, he sold souvenir T-shirts with a mock road sign printed on them:<br />
        END OF EARTH—5 MILES<br />
        DRINKWATER—10 MILES.<br />
        Tourists didn’t buy the T-shirts. Locals did. Rainbow horses aside, this dry, dusty, extra-empty spot in America’s middle wasn’t on anyone’s vacation itinerary.<br />
        “We’re wasting our time here,” Simon said. It was the first real comment she’d heard him make and pretty much summed up her own feelings. <br />
        “My brother’s not the outdoors type,” Miles told her, like that explained it.<br />
        Miles had settled into the passenger seat. Simon was in backseat, or mostly in back. His top half was hanging over the front eying her equipment—the radio, her GPS, the guns on the gun rack, the avalanche beeper that hung from her rear view mirror year round. Once he’d put his camera down, it was as though he had to find something else to focus his attention.<br />
        “You plan to be here long?” she asked.<br />
        “Don’t know,” Miles answered.<br />
        “Already been here too long,” Simon added.<br />
        “Why do you say that?”<br />
        “My brother has a short attention span,” Miles told her before Simon could answer. <br />
        Simon’s response was to give his brother the finger, a sparring gesture that Miles ignored.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Some friendly advice, you might not want to tell people around here that you’re the Gurwitt Brothers.”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Why not?”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The older Gurwitts skipped town without paying their bills.”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That was a long time ago.”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “People still remember.”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Told you we were in a time warp,” Simon said. <br />
        Miles shook his head, as if to say his brother was hopeless, then added, “Are we talking about a lot of money?”<br />
        She shrugged. “You judge. Around here ‘Gurwitt’ has come to mean an unpaid bill. People can have a ‘Gurwitt’ at the grocery store or skip town and leave a ‘Gurwitt’ at the motel.”<br />
        “Explains why we had to pay cash in advance.”<br />
        She nodded. That also meant half the county already knew there were “Gurwitts” in town and the other half would soon know. Distance meant nothing, out here, if there was news to share, and this would definitely be considered worthwhile. If she tried, she thought she might almost hear the hum. <br />
        Meanwhile they’d come to where the road climbed out of the canyon. “Hang on,” she said. “You’re not going to like this road.”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miles had already seen bad roads that morning. It was as though Willoughby thought that was the thing to show out-of-town strangers. Of course, that didn’t mean he couldn’t be impressed, he told himself, a moment later, when she started up the side of the canyon on a strip of earth he wouldn’t have recognized as a foot trail. He glanced over the seat at his brother. Simon had slid back, put on his seatbelt, and was now staring at the solid side of the road, like that was going to help. Miles was not making light. Things were serious when Simon failed to shoot the action.<br />
  &nbsp;Then the truck hit an exposed rock. The front wheels went sideways, twisting the steering wheel and lifting Sheriff Nielsen completely out of the driver’s seat. The truck lurched left. Left was a hundred foot drop. Miles reached for the steering wheel, intending to add his muscle to her effort. No doubt she was capable, but she was also short. Even under good circumstances, he’d noticed that she barely reached the clutch with the toe of her boot. <br />
        Too late. Before he could get his hands on anything solid, she’d braced one boot against the side of the truck and thrown her whole body into straightening the wheel. Without letting up on the accelerator, which was good because that might have stalled the engine, she hung on. At the same time, the truck churned ahead in four-wheel drive and kept climbing. Moments later, the rutted single-track road topped the canyon and leveled out.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miles sat back in his seat. “That was exciting.”<br />
        Nothing. She simply shifted and picked up speed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What was it that he wasn’t getting about her? </em>&nbsp;It was as if she was perpetually distracted or something. Made him wonder what she was really thinking. <br />
        A moment later, when she still hadn’t said anything, he added, “You might want to know that I manage L.A. freeways, all the time, like they’re no big deal.”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She still didn’t say anything.<br />
        He chanced another glance at his brother. Simon was wrapping his jacket around his camera. Having picked up speed, they were also churning up dust. <br />
        Miles tried again. “A lot of people underestimate the danger of L.A. freeways,” he added. “People die on them every day.”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I know. My husband died on one of those freeways.”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Shit,</em> Miles thought. “Sorry,” he said. <br />
        She shook her head. “I didn’t mean to bring that up.”<br />
        “What happened?”<br />
        She shook her head again.<br />
        “No, really, what happened?”<br />
        She looked over at him. Their eyes engaged briefly.<br />
  &nbsp;“It was late at night. He was probably going fast, too fast.” She paused and swallowed. “He turned into a wall—the concrete barrier that runs down the middle of that section of the 405.”<br />
        “He drove into the wall?” Simon asked, typically picking an awkward entrée to the conversation. <br />
  &nbsp;“It was NOT a suicide,” she said.<br />
  <em>Miles didn’t think Simon meant . . ..</em> That thought was followed by a sudden reassessment of her. <br />
        “Sorry,” he said again. “I didn’t know.”<br />
        At the same time, Sam was trying to figure out why she’d said that. No way had she intended to get personal. “My husband wasn’t the type to do something like that,” she added, because once she’d let it get personal, she felt she needed to say something more—something that explained why she’d said what she said.<br />
        Miles nodded like he understood. <br />
        Simon muttered something conciliatory. <br />
        The awkwardness lingered.<br />
        She wasn’t sure what to make of the brothers. Even though they seemed opposites, she suspected they were a tight team. Their nice-brother/obnoxious-brother routine probably worked well in Hollywood where cutting through the pretense was always the first and biggest problem. She drew a deep breath. She knew too much about their world, including the fact that their uncle was the real deal. He could make or break just about anyone in the industry. <br />
        “What were you doing in LA?” Miles asked.<br />
        This was going to get personal, like it or not. “Waiting tables, like everyone else.”<br />
        He laughed. “While you auditioned, wrote screenplays, or what?”<br />
        “I just waited tables. You know, bringing in the steady income. I was so steady, I was always there whenever anyone needed to do more important things like audition or take a meeting.”<br />
        “You needed the steady income because . . .?”<br />
        “My husband was scoring films. He was working on his third feature film when the accident happened.”<br />
  &nbsp;“No kidding. What films?”<br />
  &nbsp;“<em>A Piece of Paradise. Charlie’s Game.</em> <br />
  <em>“Charlie’s Game,”</em> Miles repeated. “That sounds familiar.”<br />
        Simon hummed a few bars—the main theme.<br />
        She had to glance into her rearview mirror to be sure she was hearing him and not something inside her head. <br />
        “Arty film about a gambler who thinks he has a sure system,” Simon added. “Did well at Sundance. Not so well in wide release.”<br />
        “My brother remembers everything he’s ever seen,” Miles told her<br />
        “Would that include the last western made here?” she asked. <br />
        “<em>Guns of Red Mesa</em>,” Simon answered. “Also failed in wide release.”<br />
        “Now, your uncle wants to make another?”<br />
  &nbsp;“Good point,” Simon said, “which brings us to the question of questions.” He paused while he imitated a drum roll on the back of the seat. “Is this the real west?”<br />
        She wasn’t sure what he was getting at.<br />
  &nbsp;“If I wanted to make a movie about the real west, is this it?” he repeated. <br />
        She didn’t know what to say. Were yodeling Swiss in the Alps real? How about Bedouins on camels in front of the Great Pyramid? By those standards, she had no idea whether or not Drinkwater’s diesel-driving cowboys and wide-open spaces were any more real than anything else. She glanced at Miles, hoping he would help. <br />
  &nbsp;“You’ll have to excuse my brother,” he said. “Simon is a master of the inappropriate question.”<br />
        “No, the inappropriate question is the one you’re dying to ask: ‘What’s nice girl, like you, doing in a place like this,’” Simon continued. “I’m looking for information. Is this the real West?”<br />
        She glanced at Miles.&nbsp; <em>Had he been coming onto her? She was surprised that she had to ask herself. Was she that out of practice?</em> <br />
        Obviously embarrassed, he avoided her glance, which pretty much answered that question. Simon’s was another matter. “Why do you ask?”<br />
        “Because my uncle, the big Hollywood producer, doesn’t need the real thing,” he told her. “He can shoot westerns on a sound stage in Poland. In other words, this is a waste of time.”<br />
        Once more she glanced at Miles. This time she thought they’d arrived at a moment of truth. “What ARE you doing here?”<br />
        “Scouting trip,” he said.<br />
        “Waste of time,” Simon repeated.<br />
        Anytime a Gurwitt showed up in Drinkwater, you had to wonder why. Willoughby and the making of a modern western wasn’t the answer. “What are you scouting for?”<br />
        “Well, that’s the nature of a scouting trip. You don’t always know.” He paused. He knew that sounded lame. He drew a deep breath, reassessed, “I’m not trying to be evasive. Truth is, this whole trip is exploratory. I don’t know what else to say.”<br />
        Simon added. “I have pictures of wild horses. He has nothing.”<br />
  <em>Curiouser and curiouser. They weren’t even sure why they were here? </em>She was going to have to think about that. Meanwhile, they’d left the canyon and gone several miles across the upper plateau. If nothing else, the size of the place worked on most people. She thumbed over her shoulder. “You won’t find that on a sound stage.”<br />
        Miles turned in the direction she’d indicated. He wasn’t sure what she meant. He saw the dust cloud they were churning, an expanse of sage, an even bigger expanse of sky. Simon seemed equally confused until he suddenly sat straighter and said, “It’s flat.”<br />
        “Flat?” Miles repeated. Then it hit him. There was no hint of the place where they’d emerged. It was like the ground had closed behind them. “No canyon,” he breathed.<br />
        “Actually there’s a labyrinth of canyons out there that you can’t see,” she told them. “Local Indians used to lure their enemies onto this plateau and then leave them to find their own way out. Or die. Most died. A year ago, we had somebody try that with his wife. An attempted murder. She was lucky.” <br />
        Miles wondered, under the same circumstances, if he would be as lucky.&nbsp;&nbsp; “Not a good place to get lost.”<br />
        “More likely it’s just a broken radio,” she answered.<br />
      It took him a moment to realize she meant the students—the ones who were out here studying birds and currently out of contact. His own predicament was more complicated. He’d come here thinking he knew what he was doing. His uncle had called and asked him to talk to an old friend in Idaho. He had some ideas that needed to be checked out. Miles thought that meant Willoughby was a rich rancher with money he was willing to gamble on a motion picture, if the project was to his liking.
