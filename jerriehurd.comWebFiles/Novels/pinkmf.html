      <br />
      A <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femme_fatale">femme fatale </a></em>is an archetype, a recurring motif, found in all world literatures, both ancient and modern. She is often portrayed as an alluring, seductive woman, who cannot be resisted and therefore leads men into compromising situations--a dangerous woman.<br />
      <br />
    Sometimes she is the villain.<br />
    <br />
    More often she uses her charms to play on a man's weakness in order to trip up his villainy. She will often appear to be amoral (an anti-heroine) in the beginning of a story and later prove to be the heroine.<br />
    <br />
    Less well known is <em>L'homme fatale</em>. Examples: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan">Don Juan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula">Count Dracula</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond">James Bond</a>, etc.</p>

Stake Out America's  Frontier</span><br />

<strong>Rocky  Mountain News</strong><br />
<em><br />
by Jerrie Hurd</em><br />
<br />
As a kid, I did what everyone my age did. When I came home from school, I  flopped down in front of the television and watched westerns Â­ <em><a href="http://www.tv.com/bonanza/show/228/summary.html">Bonanza</a>,  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047736/">Gunsmoke,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick_(TV_series)">Maverick</a></em>. It's embarrassing, but I'll confess that the power of  that visual medium was such that I began to think of the West the way it was  being presented in those series-as a place of strong men and few women. Never  mind that I was growing up on a working ranch in Idaho that included horses,  sheep, and three generations of women who had run that place since it was no  more than a hopeful claim in a raw wilderness.<br />
<br />
What's more this wasn't distant history for me. I knew all these women, even  my great-grandmother who first staked that claim and then went on to grow her  160 acre homestead into a sheep ranch that included all of Long's Valley. She  lived to be ninety-four years old. I was eleven when she died, and my  grandmother, who might best be described as &quot;Auntie Mame in boots&quot;  took over from her. My mother now runs the largest remaining piece of that ranch,  1500 acres, while my father, who died several years ago, had his own land and  held local political office. <br />
<br />
Books also didn't reflect the &quot;West&quot; I knew. <a href="http://www.louislamour.com/">Louis L'Amour</a>,  writing in the mythic tradition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Grey">Zane Grey</a>, continued a western storytelling  that had already proved successful with legend-hungry readers.<br />

      </span><span class="style6">Discussion Questions:</span></p>
      <p>In the 1880s there were real Lady Pinkerton Detectives. The   emphasis was on &quot;Lady.&quot; These women were not to disgrace the Pinkerton Detective   Agency by dressing &quot;unseemly&quot; or doing anything that might reflect badly on the   company and yet accomplish daring feats as spies and agents. How did women of that time balance those conflicting demands? Do women   today have to deal with similarly conflicting demands?</p>
      <p>Because Hollywood westerns have given most people the impression that the   American West of the 1880s was mostly a place where cowboys roamed, most people   don't know that there were Chinese miners or Lady Pinkerton detectives. What do we miss when we settle for too narrow a story of   our past?</p>
      <p>This book is based on a real incident that happened in Rock Springs,   Wyoming, when hundreds of Chinese miners were killed in a labor dispute. The   Pinkertons always worked for those who could afford to hire them--in this case,   the mine owners. The Lady Pinkerton, in this novel, faces the moral dilemma of   discovering that she's working for the wrong side. Is that a common moral   dilemma, even today? What would you do if you discovered that you were working   for a large corporation that's doing things you consider morally wrong?</p>
      <p><em>Here's an interesting footnote to this discussion. </em>Allan Pinkerton   wrote several detective novels that were bestsellers in his day. These novels   were supposedly based on famous cases that his agency had solved. He took   liberal dramatic license with these stories while calling them &quot;true   accounts.&quot; Is that Ok or a fancy way of lying?</p>
      <p>Novels are about fictionalized characters. Why do readers care about   made-up people and situations? What do you learn from a novel that you couldn't   learn from reading a non-fiction account of the same event? <em><br />
