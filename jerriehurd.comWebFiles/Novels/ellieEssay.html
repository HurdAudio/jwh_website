      What's New About Writing the Women's West<br />
      </span><br />
      From <em>R<a href="http://www.westernwriters.org/roundup.html">oundup Magazine</a></em>, December 1995<br />
      <br />
      By Jerrie Hurd<br />
      <br />
      There's a new woman riding the range.  She isn't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Wister">Owen Wister</a>'s schoolmarm, and she's not the gun-toting molls Hollywood recently gave  us in the movie <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800210648/info">Bad Girls</a>. Real women of the West have never been stand-ins for  their men. Or shadows of them.<br />
      <br />
      We always knew that.<br />
      <br />
      What's different is the current excitement attending the rediscovery of  women in the American West. I'm not talking about historical revisionism or  political correctness. Nobody is whining that these stones have been neglected  and ought to be told or taught I'm talking about the growing recognition that  stones of real women in the American West have freshness and broad appeal. In  fact &quot;The Women's West&quot; has become such a phenomenon some publishers,  such as Pocket Books, are calling it a new genre and some bookstores, such as  the <a href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp">Tattered Cover</a> in Denver, are shelving it under its own category &quot;The  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Womens-West-Susan-H-Armitage/dp/0806120673">Women's West</a>&quot; is a term borrowed from the ground breaking book of the same  title edited by Susan Armitage and Elizabeth Jameson that came out from the  University of Oklahoma Press eight years ago. That book and a subsequent flood  of scholarly books on the same subject, have presented such a strikingly  different view of women in the American West that many people describe their  first encounter with this new perspective as if they'd experienced an epiphany  Most can name the book that first exposed them to it For me, it was reading  <a href="http://www.glendonswarthout.com/">Glendon Swarthout'</a>s Spur-award winning novel, <em>The Homesman</em>.<br />
      <br />
      What's different about this view? It's more than discovering that women played  broader rules than just being ranch wives or prostitutes. It enlivens on all  levels taking in the diversity of women of all cultures and all time periods.  More, it acknowledges the rich variety of ways with which women responded to  the western experience. And beyond that, there's a shift in attitude that's  integral and specific to this region of the United States that has so shaped  our national identity.<br />
      <br />
      When it first came out in 1985, I read the entire <em><a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/college/titles/english/nalw/">Norton Anthology of  Literature by Women</a></em><a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/college/titles/english/nalw/">.</a> I was looking for a sense of my own tradition, but I  didn't find it, at least not in that volume. The Anthology contained a lot of  nice writing. There was much I admired. Yet by the tune I reached the end, I  was truly troubled by the fact that the predominate theme was victimization. In  various ways, most of the stories explored over and over how women dealt will  being victims and still managed to maintain some integral core of their being.  That's fine, and an important story in its own right, but it doesn't resonate  with my own experience growing-up in the American West.<br />
      <br />
      I come from a long line of strong western women. In the 1880's, my great  grandmother hired on with the railroad when she was 14 years old. She and a  crew of women cooked for the men who were laying railroad trucks. The women  fixed dinner and breakfast the next morning in one place. Then while the men  were laying truck, the women packed up their tent kitchen, loaded it on mules,  and moved it five, six, eight miles down the road bed, depending on how much  track was going to be put down that day. Then the women unpacked, set up the  tent again, and had dinner ready that evening by the time the men caught tip  with them. Of course they had no microwaves. No modem conveniences. They didn't  even have running water.<br />
      <br />
      That's one of the places where we all used to get hung up on stories of  women in the West. We used to emphasize the hardship of all that work with no  running water. The West was &quot;hell on women and horses,&quot; the old  saying goes. Yet I remember my great-grandmother describing her experience as  exciting. And she wasn't alone.<br />
      <br />
  &quot;I feel like urging them every one to get out and file on land. I am  very enthusiastic about women homesteading,&quot; Elinore Pruitt Stewart wrote  in her <em>Letters from a Woman Homesteader</em>. Then acknowledging that it  could be difficult at times, she added, &quot;but I realize temperament has  much to do with success in any undertaking, and persons afraid of coyotes and  work and loneliness had better let ranching alone.&quot;<br />
  <br />
      My great-grandmother would have agreed. She said that women came in two  types: those who &quot;tied pretty bows&quot; and those who &quot;killed their  own snakes.&quot; What's more, she took some pride in the fact that no one had  ever accused her of &quot; tying pretty bows.&quot; She quit cooking for railroad  crews to homestead her own place and over a 45-year period expanded her ranch  to sizable proportions. My mother now runs the Largest remaining piece of that  ranch. For several generation now it has been a matter of some pride that none  of the women in my family have ever been accused of tying pretty bows.&quot; We  all solve our own problems, &quot;kill our own snakes.&quot; On one level that  sounds silly and simplistic, but in another sense everyone knows that the  stones we tell each other make a real difference in our lives because stones  create expectations. That was certainly true in my family and not just for the  women. It takes a far more interesting man to interact with a strong woman than  the man who's simply &quot;taking care of the little lady.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      In short, unlike the stones in the <em>Norton Anthology</em> I grew up in a  tradition where women were expected to figure out how NOT to be victims, no  matter the circumstances. I think that was largely true of frontier women, and  because it's human nature to prefer winners over losers, I dunk my own family  and thus my western heritage, are more attractive to a wider audience.<br />
      <br />
      Hollywood  seems to have discovered this new approach to the stories of women. Take, for  instance, the recent role Meryl Streep played in <em><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800220730/info">The River Wild</a></em> where her  wilderness skills made the difference. Or for that matter the supporting role  Sandra Bullock played in <em><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800212379/info">Speed</a> </em>where her coolness and concentration counted. In  a recent <em>Rolling Stone</em> Interview Demi Moore elaborated on why she felt  taking her part in <em><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800228118/info">Disclosure</a></em> was a smart career move, saying its a  recognition of where the interest in women's stories is going.<br />
      <br />
      Print has echoed this change as well. The Economist in the September 24,  1994, issue, makes the same point in an article entitled &quot;The New Eve Is  No Angel.&quot; That article notes that between Glenn Close's <em><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800064266/info">Fatal  Attraction</a></em> and Sharon Stone's <em><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800173852/info">Basic Instinct</a></em> there is a noticeable  shift. Stone is not a pregnant woman scorned and deranged. Guilty or not, she  takes charge of whatever situation she finds herself in. &quot;What are you  going to do?&quot; she asks when she's told not to fight up at the police  station where she's being questioned for murder &quot;Charge me with  smoking?&quot; And then she lights up.<br />
      <br />
      There's a growing sense that fiction today needs some of that same attitude.  In March Publishers Weekly analyzed the softness in the sales of traditional  women's fiction and quoted Barbara Morrow, co-owner of <a href="http://www.northshire.com/">Northshire Bookstore </a>in Manchester, Vermont,  as saying, &quot;The response in the store to a lot of tides was 'Who cares?  There's so much repetition in these books. They are boring the audience'  Margaret Maupin of Denver's  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattered_Cover">Tattered Cover Bookstore</a> agreed, &quot;It's been very hard this year to go  through fiction and help people find books. It's pretty flat&quot; The article  goes on to discuss the fact that while publishers are still making money on  women's fiction, dig are experiencing higher than usual rates of returns even  on well known authors' books. The old stories just aren't selling like they  used to.<br />
      No wonder. The Post-Boom generation, born between 1961 and 1981, is  beginning to have an impact across the board and that includes book buying.  These so-called Generation Xer's were described in <em>US News and Word Report</em> in February as being &quot;pragmatic, non-ideological, entrepreneurial, and  action oriented&quot; They see themselves as &quot;a survival generation of  latchkey children&quot; who learned early to fend for themselves and &quot;do  end-mm around conventions that only get in the way.&quot; That description  could as aptly fit the emerging view recent scholarship has created of women in  the American West. Perhaps the current Interest in the &quot;Women's West&quot;  can best be explained by that resonance. Like women today, real women of the  American West shatter stereotypes. Finding themselves thrust outside the  Victorian culture of their mothers, they had to make their way in a &quot;man's  worldwide pluck and stamina and for the most part they enjoyed that new found  &quot;freedom.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      The broad appeal of these stories is demonstrated by the fact that <a href="http://wiredforbooks.org/bonner.htm">Cindy Bonner'</a>s recent  &quot;women's west' novels <em>Lily</em> and <em>Looking After Lily</em>, have been  successfully marketed as both adult and young adult fiction. Likewise <a href="http://www.sandracisneros.com/">Sandra  Cisneros</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Hogan_%28writer%29">Linda Hogan</a>, and <a href="http://literati.net/Silko/">Leslie Marmon Silko</a> have found wide readership for  their novels with ethnic emphasis, and <a href="http://www.kingsolver.com/home/index.asp">Barbara Kingsolver</a>'s contemporary  western novels have found a large appreciative audience.<br />
      <br />
      All of which brings us back to that new woman riding the range who's neither  schoolmarm nor bad girl. How is she best described?<br />
      <br />
      A survey of current fiction would indicate that these women protagonists can  shoot and ride and play poker with the best, but they don't rely on those  skiffs alone and that allows them to remain feminine. It also makes them more  believable than the old stock figures. On the other hand, they are not victims  and, for that reason, are less internal with their concerns than traditional  heroines of women's fiction. Nevertheless, they're likely to have a keen sense  of themselves. Having borrowed from both the western and romance traditions  these new women protagonists have struck a fresh balance. They worry less and  do more, and what they do, they do with an unapologetic gutsy determination. In  short, they're the kind of women we always knew peopled the West, the kind of  women we've always loved.<br />
