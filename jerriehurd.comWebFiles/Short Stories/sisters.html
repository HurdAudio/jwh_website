      <p>I'm not going to take the blame for this,  Allison told herself.&nbsp; I don't care.&nbsp; I'm not going to take the blame.<br />
        <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She  stopped in front of a monitor and scanned the estimated arrival times until she  found Pat's flight.&nbsp; Twenty  more minutes.&nbsp; She took out an  antacid tablet, looked at it, and then closed her eyes hoping to keep the  nausea down.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d already had enough  antacids to cause her stomach&rsquo;s problems, not cure them.&nbsp; When the worst of the sickness had passed,  she returned the pill to her pocket and continued on.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When  she got to the gate, the waiting area was full, travelers in all the chairs,  their luggage strewn around them.&nbsp; A  red-headed woman carrying several shopping bags jostled her.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Excuse  me,&quot; Allison said, backing out of her way.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  woman, as old as Allison's mother, glared, her eyes burning with unspoken  censure as if to say, who was Allison to make an older person's life harder by  standing in the way?<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm  sorry,&quot; Allison repeated.&nbsp; &quot;I  mean . . .&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  woman waddled on, a bag hitting each hip.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I  don't want to be a burden to anyone,&quot; her mother had written.&nbsp; She had written it on a piece of pale blue  stationery in her flowing, flawless hand and then left the note on her  nightstand beside the empty bottle of sleeping pills.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  wanted to scream:&nbsp; When did I ever make  you feel like a burden?&nbsp; When?&nbsp; But with a calmer, more controlled sub-voice,  she reasserted herself.&nbsp; I don't care  what Pat says, I'm not going to take the blame for this.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She  could almost hear what her older sister was going to say:&nbsp; &quot;My God, I sent money every month.&nbsp; All you had to do was check on Mother once in  a while.&nbsp; How could you let her do this?&quot;&nbsp; Pat could say that because Pat had escaped  their mother.&nbsp; She'd moved a continent  away and taken up a career in Washington,   D.C., and when she wasn't home,  Mother favored her.&nbsp; &quot;My daughter,  Patricia, met Muhammad Ali at a party last week,&quot; she bragged to friends  in Allison's presence.&nbsp; &quot;Imagine, my  daughter and Muhammad Ali at the same party?&quot;&nbsp; And Allison always knew the day her mother  received another check from Pat.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One  time she tried to give her mother money.&nbsp;  &quot;What's this?&quot;&nbsp; Mother  asked.&nbsp; &quot;And when I saw Jimmy  yesterday in pants so short his ankles stuck out?&nbsp; You take this money and buy him some new  pants from his grandma.&nbsp; That boy might  grow up to be something if he isn't made ashamed of himself.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat  won't be coming home any more, Allison thought.&nbsp;  She won't need to send money, either.&nbsp;  When Father died, she remembered, everyone thought Mother would have to  move in with me.&nbsp; I knew Father's illness  had wiped out their savings.&nbsp; I knew  Mother deserved a real home where she could belong.&nbsp; Still I'd dreaded having her move in.&nbsp; I'd dreaded becoming a little girl again in  my own home.&nbsp; Pat's checks prevented that  necessity.&nbsp; I suppose I owe her something  for that.&nbsp; Still, I'm not going to take  the blame.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  spotted Pat coming down the corridor.&nbsp;  She wore expensive tennis shoes, designer blue jeans, and an open-necked  sweater accented with two gold chains.&nbsp; Her  dark hair had been cut to toss any direction and still look good.&nbsp; Yet there was nothing casual about the way  she moved.&nbsp; She came on with an air of  directed, nervous energy, clutching her baggage claim in her right hand and  flipping its edge with her thumb as she walked.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  caught her breath.&nbsp; She straightened down  the front of her skirt.&nbsp; I've  overdressed, she thought.&nbsp; Nobody puts on  heels and hose to just meet someone's plane.&nbsp;  That's why Pat takes over.&nbsp; I've  given her the impression that I can't do anything right.&nbsp; She waved.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her  sister looked up, smiled and hurried toward her.&nbsp; They embraced.&nbsp; Allison couldn't tell which of them pulled  back first, but their greeting was shorter than usual.&nbsp; An awkward silence followed.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat  said, &quot;I didn't think the plane would ever get out of Chicago.&nbsp;  Did you have long to wait?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No,&quot;  Allison answered, not because she hadn't waited, but because the waiting didn't  matter.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How  are the children?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fine.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Let's  see, Jimmy must be in the fourth grade now.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fifth.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh,  I'll bet he's gotten so big I won't know him.&nbsp;  That'll be a switch.&nbsp; Remember  when he couldn't remember me from one visit to the next?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As  they walked to the baggage claim area, Pat kept asking about Allison's kids,  her husband's job, the other things she'd been doing lately.&nbsp; To Allison it seemed as if Pat were trying to  shout down their mother's death with plain, everyday platitudes.&nbsp; But Allison knew, sooner or later, Pat would  slip.&nbsp; Sooner or later, she'd make some  reference.&nbsp; When she does, Allison vowed,  I'm going to tell her:&nbsp; It wasn't my  fault.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They  were outside, putting the suitcases in the trunk of the car, when Pat finally  spoke to the point.&nbsp; &quot;I just don't  understand how this could happen.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What  makes you think I do?&nbsp; It happened.&nbsp; That's all.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat  shook her head.&nbsp; &quot;I didn't mean it  like that.&nbsp; You didn't fill in many  details on the phone and so naturally I wondered.&nbsp; I guess for me it hasn't really sunk in  yet.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How  could I have said much?&quot; Allison asked.&nbsp;  &quot;The police were still there.&nbsp;  People from the neighboring apartments were gawking.&nbsp; They wanted to take the body away.&nbsp; I had to sign papers.&nbsp; I was doing absolutely the best I  could.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I  know.&nbsp; It must have been awful.&nbsp; I don't blame you for not wanting to talk  about it.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;All  right,&quot; Allison said.&nbsp; &quot;I'll  tell you.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They  got in the car.&nbsp; Allison started the  motor.&nbsp; &quot;It was yesterday.&nbsp; I always picked up mother on Thursdays.&nbsp; We usually drove to the market and if she had  an appointment downtown, I waited for her.&nbsp;  I want you to know it wasn't always convenient to pick up Mother on  Thursdays like that.&nbsp; I had to get a  babysitter and sometimes other things would come up, but I always did it.&nbsp; I always picked her up and drove her wherever  she wanted to go.&nbsp; Mother could count on  Thursdays.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She  paused, swallowed, then continued.&nbsp; &quot;I have a key to Mother's  apartment.&nbsp; Mother wanted me to have  it.&nbsp; 'You never know,&rsquo; she used to say,  'what if something should happen?'&quot;&nbsp;  But I never had any reason to use the key before yesterday.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  hesitated.&nbsp; The experience was still  vivid enough that she had to force herself to relive it.&nbsp; &quot;I remember taking the key out.&nbsp; I remember thinking Mother might have stepped  out for a minute or simply forgotten to turn up her hearing aid.&nbsp; Yet somehow I knew.&nbsp; I knew when I had to use the key that  something terrible had happened.&nbsp; The TV  was going.&nbsp; Mother left the TV on and  there was a teacup and a few breadcrumbs on the kitchen table.&nbsp; As I passed the bathroom, I noticed she had washed  out some stockings and hung them over the shower door.&nbsp; Mother was never one to leave anything  undone.&nbsp; I found her in the bedroom.&nbsp; At first I thought she was asleep.&nbsp; She'd lain down and pulled the quilt up over  her.&nbsp; It was the blue and white patchwork  one I gave her last Christmas.&nbsp; It made  it for her myself because she kept saying how she  wanted something pretty on her bed.&nbsp; She  hoped before she died, she'd have something pretty on her bed.&nbsp; Remember how she used to say things like  that?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  paused and shook her head slowly before she continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;For her everything was life or death.&nbsp; She used to claim that the strangest things  might cause her end.&nbsp; You know.&nbsp; You remember.&nbsp;  If this wasn&rsquo;t right or that wasn&rsquo;t right, it was sure to be the death  of her.&nbsp; Remember?&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I  remember.&nbsp; What did you do when you found  her?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Nothing.&quot;&nbsp;  She shot a glance at her sister.&nbsp;  &quot;No one could have done anything.&nbsp;  It was already too late.&nbsp; I tried  to shake her awake, but I knew before I touched her.&nbsp; Even before I felt how cold she'd become, I  knew.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You  said there was a note.&nbsp; What happened to  the note?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The note.&nbsp; Allison  remembered picking it up.&nbsp; She remembered  reading it, staring at it, wondering what it meant.&nbsp; But she couldn't remember what she'd done  with it.&nbsp; When the police arrived, the  lieutenant asked her if there was a note.&nbsp;  She'd said, &quot;No,&quot; and then, &quot;Yes,&quot; and then, &quot;I  don't know.&quot;&nbsp; What had she done with  it?<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I  tore it into little pieces and flushed it,&quot; Allison answered.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why?&nbsp; Why did you do that?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You're  right.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They  drove in silence.&nbsp; Pat fussed with the  loose edge of the car's upholstery.&nbsp;  Finally she said, &quot;Why do you think she did it?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How  should I know?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I  don't know.&nbsp; I just thought . . .&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  shook her head.&nbsp; &quot;I think she  thought she had cancer.&nbsp; You know how  Mother felt about cancer.&nbsp; You know how  afraid she was that one of us would have to take care of her the way she had to  take care of Dad.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did  she see a doctor?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I  tried to get her to see one.&nbsp; My God.&nbsp; Don't you  think I tried?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why  didn't she tell me about it?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I  don't know.&nbsp; Maybe she didn't want to  bother you with it.&nbsp; You're always so  busy.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh,  I see.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm  going to stop at Mom's apartment,&quot; Allison said.&nbsp; &quot;We need to pick out a dress for her to  wear.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sure,&quot;  Pat said.&nbsp; &quot;That's fine.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside  the apartment, Pat circled their mother's living room, pausing once to touch  one of the knickknacks, a spotted china dog.&nbsp;  Allison watched her a moment and then she walked into the bedroom and  began flipping through the dresses in their mother's closet.&nbsp; Pat entered, paced to the window, turned back  and perched herself on the edge of their mother's bed.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  stiffened.&nbsp; How could Pat sit on that  bed?&nbsp; Then she knew.&nbsp; Pat hadn't seen their mother lying dead  there.&nbsp; Pat might have testified before  Congress and been on TV and held positions no woman had ever held before, but  she would never know how it felt to find her own mother dead.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  bed itself had been smoothed.&nbsp; The blue  and white quilted coverlet had been pulled up straight and tucked under the  pillows.&nbsp; A neighbor lady had come in  while the police were still there, Allison remembered.&nbsp; She'd asked if she could tidy up.&nbsp; She must have made the bed.&nbsp; It seemed strange.&nbsp; Every time she turned, she expected to see  the bed as she saw it yesterday.&nbsp; She  couldn't get over being surprised at the neatness.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat  cleared her throat each time before she spoke.&nbsp;  Still she only mumbled niceties.&nbsp;  &quot;I don't know,&quot; and &quot;Whatever you think,&quot;  and &quot;I suppose that one will be fine.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  folded a navy blue suit over her arm.&nbsp;  &quot;We might as well go then.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat  glanced around her as if there was something in the room she'd missed.&nbsp; She sighed.&nbsp;  &quot;I've got something to say.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here  it comes, Allison thought.&nbsp; At last, here  it comes.&nbsp; She looked toward the  window.&nbsp; It was nearly dark.&nbsp; Michael and the children must be wondering  what has taken so long.&nbsp; They don't know  about stopping at the apartment to pick out a burial dress.&nbsp; They offered to come with me, but I preferred  to come alone.&nbsp; I know what Pat wants to  say.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I  could have come back home to California  more often,&quot; Pat said.&nbsp; &quot;I get  six weeks of vacation a year.&nbsp; If I had come home oftener, maybe.&nbsp; Last month, I had some time last month.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d come home then.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  shook her head.&nbsp; Why was the story always  the same?&nbsp; Maybe it didn&rsquo;t matter where  you went&mdash;east, west, round the world&mdash;women always carried the same baggage, the  same sense of responsibility that they could never, never shed.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You  couldn&rsquo;t have known,&rdquo; she said.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No,  I could have sent more money, too.&nbsp; I own  two cars and two fur coats and two toasters.&nbsp;  What person living alone needs two of anything?&nbsp; But I didn't send more money because of  you.&nbsp; Whenever I called, it was always  the same. &nbsp;Mother talked of you&mdash;you and  your kids, you and your husband, you and your house.&nbsp; 'I went shopping with Allison today,' Mom  would say.&nbsp; 'Allison has such a fine  family,' she'd say.&nbsp; 'When are you going  to get married?' she'd ask.&nbsp; She never  understood about my work.&nbsp; She'd ask,  'What is it that you do exactly?'&nbsp; Even  after I explained, she'd just make that clucking noise with her tongue&mdash;you know  the one&mdash;and tell me about your quilts and the quilting classes you were  teaching.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  felt a new nausea rising in her.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat's  voice broke.&nbsp; &quot;I wasn't good  enough.&nbsp; If I'd been better . . .&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No,  don't say that.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You  must hate me.&nbsp; You probably never want to  see me again.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No,&quot;  Allison said.&nbsp; &quot;No, I won't let you  take the blame for this.&nbsp; I won't.&nbsp; I won't.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison  reached for her sister.&nbsp; She felt Pat  press her head against her shoulder, hot, breathing hard.&nbsp; Her own tears ran down her cheeks and  sprinkled her sister's hair.&nbsp; They hugged  closer, rocking gently on the edge of their mother's bed.&nbsp; </p>

      <p>How does Jerrie Hurd know about sisters and old baggage? Maybe because she has four sisters: <br />
        Karen, an investment advisor<br />
        Sharen, an electrical engineer<br />
        Becky, a school teacher<br />
      Janet, a  woodcarver</p>
