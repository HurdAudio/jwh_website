      Sunday Oregonian</p>
      <p><strong>WHO:</strong> Jerrie Hurd</p>
      <p><strong>LITERARY CONTRIBUTIONS:</strong> Three novels in a genre called &quot;the women's   West&quot;: &quot;Kate Burke Shoots the Old West,&quot; &quot;Miss Ellie's Purple Sage Saloon&quot; and   &quot;The Lady Pinkerton Gets Her Man.&quot; Hurd got her start writing short stories,   most with a contemporary setting and &quot;all with a Western flavor. We have this   idea that women sort of reluctantly followed men west, but many came because   they knew they could do things here that they'd never done before. It was a   conscious decision.&quot;</p>
      <p><strong>LOCAL CONNECTION:</strong> Hurd lives in Boulder, Colo., but she lived in Lake   Oswego for 10 years. She come back to Oregon once a year for a writing group in   Cannon Beach.</p>
      <p><strong>OCCUPATIONS:</strong> In addition to writing full time, Hurd serves on the   board of trustees of the Women of the West Museum, a project under way in   Boulder. She also is president of Women Writing the West, an organization she   helped found about four years ago. &quot;It's grown to over 400 members, most of them   published. Editors, agents, publishers, jointly trying to bring attention to   this genre.&quot;</p>
      <p><strong>APPROPRIATE BACKGROUND:</strong> Hurd grew up on a 1,500 acre Idaho ranch that   once was managed by her great-grandmother. The largest remaining piece of that   ranch is now run by her mother. &quot;It was a unique way to grow up but, like most   people, I didn't appreciate it at the time. As a kid, I'd come home and flop   down in front of the television and watch Westerns!&quot;</p>
      <p><strong>NEXT PROJECTS:</strong> A nonfiction book on the women in her family. The   working title is &quot;Just Above Bone.&quot; Hurd is also working on a fourth   novel. This one is about a woman sheriff in a large rural county and takes place   in modern times--&quot;Rainbow Horses.&quot;</p>

              <td valign="top" colspan="3"><p><strong><span class="style5">Frequently Asked Questions:</span><br />
                <br />
                How Long Have You Been Writing?</strong> <br />
Always. That's the short answer. The long answer is that I've been writing  and publishing short stories in little literary magazines for years and years.  Then in 1994, I sold my first novel-actually I sold three novels at once to  Pocket Books as a series of popular stories about the new view of what women  were really to doing in the American West. <br />
<strong>Where Do You Get Your Ideas?</strong> <br />
Getting ideas has never been a problem. It's working those ideas up into all  the fully-developed scenes  that requires work  and patience. But in the case of these novels, I read <em>The Women's West</em> edited by Susan Armitage and Elizabeth Jameson and immediately realized that  the real stories of women in the American West had rarely been told. I wanted to  popularize those stories. <br />
The rest of the answer to this question is that I keep files and files of  clippings and notes. Eventually some of those notes begin to attract other  notes and ideas until I know I have something big enough to be a novel. <br />
<strong>How do you work?</strong> <br />
I prefer to work late at night. The phone stops ringing after 10 p.m. and I  often do my best work between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. I'm definitely not a morning  person. I use a computer, of course. 
I think about my work as scenes. I write a scene until I'm happy with it.  Then I write another. When several scenes have formed a chapter, I often go  back and rework to get the flow right. I'm a better re-writer than a writer.  Nobody sees my first draft. And I frequently throw out as much as two-thirds of  what I write. Often I have to write scenes that I need to understand the story  but that never actually make it into the final book. Creative work is not  efficient. I think of it as &quot;playing with the words.&quot; <br />
I work from a detailed outline which is essentially a description of what  goes in each chapter. My outlines can run 30 pages single spaced for one novel.  But by the time I finish a novel, it will be quite different from the original  outline. That's good. It means the work has grown in the process of becoming. <br />
<strong>Even your short stories show careful research. How do you do the  research?</strong> <br />
I believe that a researched element gives an added dimension to fiction,  even in short stories. I think most readers appreciate learning something  interesting if it is woven into the story in a way that is essential to the  fiction. In my case, I usually start with an interesting background first. Then  I form a plot and then I let the characters emerge from that background and  plot. That means the interesting background (the researched element) is truly  an intregal part of my fiction. Not everyone works this way and in fact the  additional-researched element-can be a burden getting in the way of the story  if it's not handled carefully. <br />
I begin my research by going  to the children's library. I swear you can find a basic book on  almost any subject in the children's section of your local library. Wonderful  resource. Then once I've got the basics down, I interview experts and do follow  up research. I do quite a bit of research before I start a novel, but I also do  on-going research as I'm writing because I will discover a need for more  information. At the end of a project, I always have a file of interesting  tidbits that I'd hoped would get into the story, but never did. Oh, well . . . <br />
<strong>Have you always lived in Colorado?</strong> <br />
No. I grew up in Idaho  on a ranch originally homesteaded by my great grandparents. My mother still  runs the largest remaining piece of that ranch-1500 acres between Bone and Soda Springs, Idaho.  You'll need a detailed map to find those places. <br />
I graduate from Bonneville High School in Idaho    Falls, Idaho. <br />
I have a bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado <br />
I have a master's degree (MFA) from the University   of Oregon <br />
My family and I lived in Oregon and New Jersey and New Mexico as well as Colorado. <br />
<strong>Do you travel to the places you write about?</strong> <br />
Yes. I do the &quot;book research&quot; but then I like to &quot;walk the  ground.&quot; Places have a certain sense about them. <br />
Most recently I spent time traveling and talking to people (law enforcement  officers, ranchers, and environmentalists) who live and work on the Owyhee  desert in Idaho, Nevada  and Oregon. <br />
<strong>How long does it take for you to write a novel?</strong> <br />
My first one took two years to write and about that long  to sell. The second and third novels took about eighteen months to write. The current novel has taken years, partly because I was also working on a nonfiction title and taking my photography to a professional level. It takes about as long to put together a solo gallery show as to write a book. Excuses, excuses, I suspect. Truth is, I know other writers who churn  books out at a much faster pace. Don't know what makes the difference. <br />
<strong>When you're writing a novel, do the characters come alive and seem like  real people?</strong> <br />
Absolutely. They're better than friends because I can hear them think and I  usually know  why they're doing things. Can't say the same for family and friends no matter how well I think I know them!<br />
<strong>How often do you teach fiction seminars?</strong> <br />
I used to do more of them. I like teaching. I suspect I'll get back to this.<br />
<strong>Do you like the covers on your books?</strong> <br />
No. To make a long story short, I think they are too romance-novel. I have  explained this to my publisher over and over again. Publishers figure they know  how to sell books and what will sell. Maybe they're right. Personally I hate  pink flowers and I know lots and lots of women to feel the same way. It is a  fact that newspapers in the country dropped their women's pages in order to  increase their women's readership. I think the same thing needs to happen in  fiction. Women represent 60-70 of all book buyers. Covers don't need to be  patronizingly feminine to attract these buyers. <br />
<strong>If you could have one wish, what would it be?</strong> <br /> 
More time.
<br />
<strong>Which of your novels do you like the best?</strong> <br />
The one I'm working on. <br />
<strong>What do you like best about writing?</strong> <br />
The sense of discovery. Discovering the story. Discovering the characters.  Discovering the ending.<br />
<strong>Do you have other interests?</strong> <br />
Photography. I consider myself as much a photographer as a writer. I like music,  especially modern-day composers. I like to go to coffee-shop poetry readings.  Lots of the stuff is awful, but every once in awhile a single line can make the  whole evening worthwhile. I love theater. I have season tickets to almost  everything in this area. <br />
              <strong>Share something about your family<br />
              </strong>I'm married to the guy I met when I was 19-years-old. He's a science/business type. His career is the reason we've moved around the country. I have two sons. One is an animator with Disney. The other does sound and music for video games. I have two grandchildren.</p>

      <p><strong><em>BLOG INTERVIEW</em></strong>:</p>
      <p>Author <a href="http://alkek.library.txstate.edu/swwc/archives/writers/bonner.html">Cindy Bonner </a>interviews Jerrie Hurd--common interest, women's history in the American West.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Cindy Bonner Asks:</em></strong> <br />
          <strong><em>Q: </em></strong>How important to you  is the accuracy of the history in your novels, and how much do you research? <br />
          <strong><em>A: </em></strong>Very important. But  I'm talking about a novelist's kind of accuracy. <br />
      Historian and WHA President, <a href="http://www.fulcrum-books.com/contributorinfo.cfm?ContribID=4532">Glenda Riley </a>asked me to speak at the <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/~wha/">Western  History Association </a>the year they met in Minneapolis.  She thought historians would enjoy knowing how novelists use historical  research in their stories. I agreed but I went with fear and trembling. I  expected professional historians to take exception to my leaps of creativity.  For example, I have Allan Pinkerton appear in my novel THE LADY PINKERTON GETS  HER MAN. Pinkerton never traveled West although he and  his detective organization were a major influences on the development of mining  and railroads here. In the discussion that followed my speech, it was clear  that most of my audience recognized the dramatic demands of story and appreciated how I'd woven research and drama together.<br />
      <strong><em>Q: </em></strong>Your novels have at  their core a strong, independent woman. Since your novels to this point have  all been historical, how do you keep this kind of woman from seeming like an  anachronism, or from becoming the stereotypical &quot;woman in pants&quot; seen  so often today in genre fiction and film? <br />
          <strong><em>A: </em></strong>I use my family as  models. I come from four generations of women who ran a working ranch in Idaho. I grew up there.  My mother is still running the last remaining 1500 acres of that ranch. A  writer can only write what she knows, and the women I know never wore buckskin  or strapped on guns, the way Hollywood sometimes portrays western women, but  they never stepped back and waited to be rescued either. <br />
          <strong><em>Q: </em></strong>Do you think you will  ever write anything but novels dealing with a certain aspect of history. How  about one in the present? <br />
          <strong><em>A: </em></strong>It's like you're  reading my mind. I'm writing a modern-day novel right now, RAINBOW HORSES. My  protagonist is the elected sheriff of Drinkwater    County, Idaho (a  made-up name for a real place) who is the daughter of ranchers. <br />
          <strong><em>Q: </em></strong>You told me that you  often burn the midnight oil. Describe your typical working day. Do you have a  prescribed amount of time that you spend at your desk? Do you have self-imposed  deadlines or goals? <br />
          <strong><em>A: </em></strong>I often work until 2  a.m.  I walk the dogs, return calls  and check e-mail before noon. I try to schedule meetings and appointments   in early the afternoon. So it's evening before I get to my &quot;real  work&quot; and 10 p.m. before it gets quiet enough to get really creative. Does  anyone really care about this stuff? <br />
        I don't log a specific number of hours at the desk and I tell people I don't  have goals because I think that defeats the purpose of being your own boss. In fact, I work long hours most days and I do have a pretty  definite sense of where I'm going. <br />
        <strong><em>Q: </em></strong>What are your goals? <br />
        <strong><em>A: </em></strong>If I had answered the  above question, &quot;no.&quot; I could have skipped this one. <br />
        My goal is to change the story of the West. Instead of the lone cowboy  riding into the sunset, I want to be part of leaving a richer legacy of story  attached to my region. Is that lofty enough? <br />
        <strong><em>Q: </em></strong>You have been known  to spend time at writers' retreats. What do you get from these places that you  feel helps your creativity? <br />
      <strong><em>A: </em></strong>A chance to enter my  story and live there for a while without interruption. I find it really hard near the end of writing  a novel to hold the story, with all its myriad details, in my head and bring it  to a conclusion. It really helps to have several weeks when I don't have to  think about anything other than the story. Besides, it makes my friends really  jealous. My last retreat was in the south of France.</p>
