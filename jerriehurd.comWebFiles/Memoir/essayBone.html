    <td height="505"><p><span class="style1">Just Above Bone</span>      is a memoir that explores the power of family stories. <br />
        Want to explore your own family stories?<br />
        <br />
        First things first. Before you can gather family  stories, you need to assess what you already know.<br />
        <strong><br />
        MAKE A PLAN</strong><br />
        <strong>Write a brief family       history.</strong><br />
        While you're writing this history, note what you know and don't know and       make notes of gaps you'd like to fill in. </p>
      <ul type="disc"><li><strong>Make a list of who can       help you fill in the stories.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>What photographs, letters,       or other family artifacts do you have?</strong> <br />
          Who has items you might want to copy of photograph? </li>
        <li><strong>What traditions does your       family observe?</strong> <br />
          Try to assess why some traditions have survived while others haven't? Are       stories hidden in those traditions? What would you like your children or       other members of your family to continue to observe? Can you articulate       why? </li>
        <li><strong>Question your own motives.</strong><br />
          Write a letter to yourself about why you want to gather your family's       stories. Put this letter away. After you've finished all the steps in this       guide, read the letter and note how much you and your ideas about your       family&rsquo;s history have changed. That will be a story in itself. </li>
        <li><strong>Make a plan.</strong><br />
          Decide on the first three things you'd like to do in pursuit of your       family's stories. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><br />
          <strong>TRY AN INTERVIEW</strong><br />
        Every interview is different and should be. Knowing how to get the most out of an interviews is as much art as skill. It helps to  remember that an interview should be fun, like a good conversation. Knowing how  to write-up an interview is also part of the art.</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Interview a friend you'd       like to know better.</strong><br />
          This will give you a chance to discover how you are most comfortable       talking to someone. Will you take notes? Use a tape recorder? Take someone       along with you? </li>
        <li><strong>Write up your test       interview.</strong><br />
          Notice what material you wish you had. How could you have gotten a fuller       interview? Try going back and filling in, but also remember,       each interview will be different and how you write it up will also be       different. </li>
        <li><strong>Make an appointment to       interview someone in your family and then do it.</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Here's something       interesting&mdash;just to try.</strong> Do an imaginary interview with someone whose dead. What's the value in this imaginary       interview? </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>GO HOME</strong><br />
        Most stories are connected to a place. One reason to collect family stories  is to keep yourself and your family connected to a place and a past-grounded in  some real sense.</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Write an essay about your       home.</strong><br />
Where's home for you? In our mobile world, &quot;home&quot; is       increasingly difficult to identify. Are you having trouble with this one?       Maybe you have more than one place that you call home. If your family       immigrated recently, there may be a place far away and one that is closer       now. Whatever your situation, write about it. Try writing about the       particular place you live now and then in the larger sense of how you       identify yourself as being from somewhere. </li>
        <li><strong>Write an origin story of       your family.</strong><br />
When and where does your family begin. How did       you get to the place you call &quot;home.&quot; </li>
        <li><strong>Find and re-tell one folk       story from &quot;home.&quot;</strong> </li>
      </ul>
      <p><br />
          <strong>CONNECT YOURSELF TO HISTORY</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Pick an event in history       that affected your family.</strong> <strong>Research the event until you feel fairly certain       you know the official facts.</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Can you fit your family's       story into the larger narrative?</strong><br />
          Sometimes, this can be difficult. Official versions of history may not       always be right or may not always include the same detail as family       versions. Can you figure out how to check the facts of your family story       and of the official version and vice versa? Official history often has       been shaped by historians who had their own reasons for telling the story       as they did. Same with family versions. At some point you'll have to       decide what standard of truth you will apply to your family stories. In       your fact checking, you'll need to be more careful, but don't always       assume that the family version is wrong. Dig. Do the detective work. There       may be times when you cannot establish the truth. Then what will you do? </li>
        <li><strong>In what ways has the media       or popular culture taken over your family's history and turned it into       something that it isn't? For example, people who grew up on ranches don&rsquo;t       necessarily connect with the movie version of cowboys. Can you write a few       paragraphs about this problem?</strong> </li>
      </ul>
      <p><br />
          <strong>WHAT ABOUT YOU?</strong><br />
        Family history is happening all the time. If you don't capture your own part  in that unfolding drama, you will leave a gap as big as the ones you've been  trying to fill with your research.</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Write a factual account of       your life.</strong><br />
          This will cover the important dates and places and parts of current events       that you witnessed or participated in. Don't be afraid to express your       opinions on the things you saw and did. You will also need to check your       facts. No one remembers things perfectly. </li>
        <li><strong>Capture yourself as a       myth.</strong><br />
          Who are you really? Under the facts, how do you see yourself? Very likely       you are different in different situations. Maybe you need to write more       than one myth of yourself. Think about what you'd really like someone else       to know about you and your life. </li>
        <li><strong>Read the letter you in the       first exercise. Add something about what's changed about you since then.</strong><br />
          <br />
    Keep in mind that this is just a beginning. You will have other ideas of what  you need to do to collect your family's stories. <br />
