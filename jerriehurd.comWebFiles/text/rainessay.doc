
The Story Of The Story

	Main Street, Silverton, Colorado, goes nowhere.  You have to find Highway 550 to get out of town.  A lot of people have.  According to Sheriff Sue Kurtz, the population of her county has dwindled to less than six hundred and continues to drop.
        On the Monday afternoon when I sat in her office, she was the only law officer on duty in “at least a four hundred square mile area,” maybe more, depending on where the neighboring sheriff happened to be patrolling that day.  It was quiet.  The phone only rang once the whole time.  She was preparing for court the next morning, working her way through a stack of files, and complaining about people who couldn’t take “the altitude.”
	“Fear of high mountain passes” was what she blamed for keeping her part of America from prospering.  “We had this guy once.  I thought he was having a heart attack.  Turns out he was hyperventilating.  He’d gotten himself over one high pass and then realized there was no way out of here without going over another one, just as bad.  One of my deputies had to drive him out.”
        “Where was he from?” I asked, just making conversation.
        “Some place flat,” she said with enough tone to keep me from asking about flatlanders again.
        Sheriff Sue Kurtz likes where she lives and works.  Nevertheless, San Juan County, Colorado, has a lot of “altitude.”  Silverton, the county seat, is nine thousand three hundred feet high, and things go up from there.  No place for the fainthearted.  After awhile I couldn’t help thinking that might include me.  I’d called and cancelled our interview the previous Friday when the pass in question required chains.  Her dispatcher wanted to argue the point.  “Oh, you’ll be OK if you’ve got a four-wheel drive or good snow tires.”  
        I didn’t.  I drive a two-seater—a sporty model that doesn’t even haul groceries.  When Sheriff Kurtz and I walked out of the courthouse together, she spotted it immediately.  Didn’t belong.  “Mine,” I explained.  She shrugged in a way that made it clear that she had about as much use for that frill as a flatlander sucking too much of her rarified air.
	Her air is so rarified she may have forgotten how normal people live.  Did I mention that I had to wait on the highway for a crew to clear avalanche debris ahead of me?  That was on a good day, when there were no travel restrictions.  Did I mention that Sheriff Kurtz puts on a bulletproof vest and an avalanche beeper every morning before she goes to work?  “I have to assume that everyone in my county is armed,” she explained.  Turns out that it’s been a long time since she’s been in an actual shoot-out, but she thinks the avalanche beeper will save her life someday.
	Are there women sheriffs in the American West like Sally Nielsen?
        Well, there is Sue Kurtz.  
        She’s the only woman, at the moment, but the problems that make the job of an elected sheriff in the modern West challenging are not necessarily gender related.  I asked if I could “ride along” with Sheriff Gary Amon in Idaho.  A “ride-along” is a fairly common request from a journalist who wants to ride in a patrol car with an officer in order to experience a “typical day” on the job.  Sheriff Amon’s “ride-along” was anything but typical.
	Using the highway in front of his courthouse as a runway, we took off in a Cessna 206, flying.  That was after he showed me photographs of the wreck he’d walked away from and after his deputy, the pilot, showed me his dog’s pilot’s license.  The joke was on the licensing agency.  The license was legit, and “Corky,” the dog, jumped in the plane like it was the back of a pickup and rode along, sometimes in the co-pilot’s seat.
	The highway we used for take-off was the main road, but nobody seemed too worried about stopping traffic.  Murphy, the county seat, has a population of fifty, including the inmates in Sheriff Amon’s jail, and like Silverton, Colorado, the main road through town doesn’t really go anywhere.  “If the weather’s good and if the creeks aren’t running and if you have four-wheel drive and if you’ve also got good clearance, then you might make it all the way to Jordan Valley, Oregon, where you can pick up the highway again,” the sheriff explained.  A lot of “ifs.”  In reality the road was paved for a few miles, graded for a few more miles and impassible after that.  That’s why we were in the air.  Sheriff Amon has patrol cars, all of them with four-wheel drive and high clearances, but even specially equipped, they’re limited in the area they can cover and the time it takes to cover that area. 
	Once in the air, we cruised up narrow canyons looking for marijuana fields.  We dipped down over ranches where we delivered a restraining order.  We climbed higher into the mountains looking for big horn sheep and the international poachers who prey on them.  All the while, Sheriff Amon told me about his problems with meth-labs, a recent gang-related killing, and the people from Boise who drive into the middle of the desert to blow their heads off.  “We get the messy ones,” he said, matter-of-factly.  Turns out that also applied to highway crashes.  Nobody drove the long, lonesome stretches across his county at anything close to the speed limit.  But if you get lost there, chances are good that he can find you.  He was proud of his search and rescue volunteers.  That included their dogs and their horses and their “moms” who made coffee and sandwiches.
        Then, in a place where he had to use a hand-held GPS in order to get a fix, we found the poachers we’d been looking for—wealthy Japanese taking trophy big horn sheep.  They had two planes and a camp on the ground and something else that someone quickly covered with a tarp.  
        Moments earlier, the sheriff and his deputy had been buzzing herds of antelope for me, showing off.  Now this was serious.  Sheriff Amon radioed Boise.  We circled.  He needed the numbers off the planes and discussed with his deputy, the pilot, how low they could pass over the planes on the ground, considering the high-powered rifles they’d spotted and the safety of their passenger—me!  His plane wasn’t marked.  They bantered the question of whether or not they should get their plane marked someday.  They wondered whether that would “help” or make them a “bigger target.”  If this situation turned “ugly,” they had no backup.  In fact, Sheriff Amon took that moment to explain to me that all the men in his office patrolled alone, knowing that if they got into trouble, backup was hours away. 
        Sheriff Amon’s county is larger than the state of Massachusetts, populated by less than seven thousand people, and honeycombed with canyonlands—deep, narrow slits that represent an uniquely young geology, as landscapes go.  That fact was impressed upon me by a “world-famous” geologist.  We met in a bar in a place called Jarbridge.  Several people had told me that I needed to talk to him.  Every one of them had described him as “world-famous,” almost as if that description was a part of his name.  I never found out what earned him that respect.  The night I talked to him, he was too drunk for details, so he worked on the one fact he thought I ought to know, namely that the canyonlands around us were only twelve thousand years old.  He compared that to places in Australia, where he’d worked recently, and where there were exposed rocks thought to be seven or eight billion years old.  
        The twelve thousand years that have passed since the catastrophic volcanic explosion that covered that area and land as far away as Nebraska was less than a tick on the geologic clock, a mere flicker of time.  We were sitting in a bar in a canyon sandwiched between sheer rock walls that were only a flicker old.  Did I understand that?  Could I wrap my mind around the difference between that and a billion years?  It was a sobering thought, but not sobering enough to help him. 
        How I got to the bar and that evening is another story.  I wanted to meet Janet Ocrowley and a dentist from Mountain Home, Idaho, who’d been instrumental in keeping those canyonlands from becoming a military bombing range.  They’d also been involved in several other local environmental issues including an effort to make the entire plateau and its canyons a national park, something on the scale of an American Serengeti.  Janet gave me a bumper sticker that reads:  Visit Owyhee National Park.  I loved the idea of sporting a souvenir on my car from a place that didn’t really exist, but I knew the sight of that bumper sticker would anger the local ranchers, and I needed to talk to some of them as well.  Land-use is a heated debate all over the American West, and not something that’s likely to be resolved any time soon, partly because there’s no clear right or wrong, but mostly because there is a lot of emotion attached to the subject.
        Back to Janet Ocrowley.  I agreed to come to her for the interview, knowing that wasn’t simple.  Janet lived in a place called Hot Springs, population 12, that wasn’t on any map I had.  Not an unusual set of circumstances.  There are roads and other “improvements” all over the American West that pre-date the US Forest Service but that have never been acknowledged as “official” by that agency.  
        That’s another source of friction, out West.  In fact, shortly after I visited Janet, the Forest Service tried to close one of those “traditional” but unofficial roads and sparked the “Jarbridge Shovel Rebellion,” an uprising that made the New York Times repeatedly throughout the fall of 1999 and the spring of 2000.  At the height of that grassroots rebellion, ranchers, miners, loggers, and small-business owners across twenty western states gathered more than 9,000 shovels, which they paraded in the streets of Elko, Nevada, in support of efforts to rebuild that road, by hand, using those shovels, if necessary.  
        Happens that was the road Janet Ocrowley lived on.  
        If you live in a place that’s not on the map, you need to give your visitors careful instructions.  Janet’s went something like this:  “Stop at the Bruneau Café and ask for the Three Creek Road.  It’s a dirt highway.  Go south on the Three Creek for about seventy-three miles.  There will be a fork in the road.  Keep right.  At the top of the canyon, turn again . . ..”  I don’t remember the rest.  It got more complicated—something about bridges and canyon entrances and a place where I needed to be careful that I didn’t drive off the road, especially if it was dark.  
        It was well after dark on a Saturday night when I arrived.  The dentist was to meet us the next morning.  Janet greeted me at the door, bag over her shoulder, coat in her hand.  She wanted to go to the big Saturday night dinner at the bar in Jarbridge, another fifteen miles down the canyon over the disputed road.  We took her car because she “knew the road,” meaning she knew where all the washes were.  
        When we finally arrived in Jarbridge, there were at least fifty people already in the bar.  I have no idea where they all came from, but the place was hopping—music, food, dancing, drinking, a minor altercation going on in the street.  We had trouble finding a place to park where we wouldn’t block the canyon.  When we got to the front door, we were met by a waitress, who asked if we had reservations.  
        I’m not making this up.  
        We didn’t have reservations.  That meant we would have to wait twenty minutes to be seated and the prime rib was already gone.  It was chicken or pork chops or nothing for us.  Sometime later, I sat down to a chicken and gravy supper and that discussion about "billions of years” with the famous geologist.
        Even later, people in the bar began telling Coyote stories—an old western tradition.  In Jarbridge they liked Coyote stories where the Old Trickster made fools of the Feds—particularly Forest Service employees.  It was as though they anticipated the coming trouble.  More like, to them, it was on-going.
        The legend of the hoopsnake, as told in the book, is also real, as is the old Indian idea that colored horses guard the various directions, although those tales are less well known than Coyote stories.  Likewise, few people know where to find pictographs of horses, but if you know where to look, they’re there.  On the other hand, almost everyone has an opinion about wild horses.  People, like those in the bar at Jarbridge, like to tell about the times when they’ve caught glimpses of wild horses.  In many ways wild horses have become symbolic of the larger, more complex problems of the modern West.  Lots of folks love wild horses and love seeing them, but nobody knows what to do about them, which means they’ll probably be gone soon.
        That night I slept on a cushion on the floor of Janet Ocrowley’s cabin.  There are no motels in Owyhee County, Idaho.  Remember, it’s an area the size of Massachusetts.  When I asked Sheriff Amon to recommend a place where I might stay the night before I was to interview him, he laughed.  “Bring a sleeping bag,” he told me.  
        No tourist traps for as far as the eye can see.  
        No tourists either.
        I thought that might be a problem the night I used my sleeping bag at the Idaho Hotel.  The Idaho Hotel is an over-sized, grand, old Victorian lady standing at the center of the largest ghost town in America—a place with over seventy abandoned buildings.  At least, that’s how it’s described on the postcards you buy in Boise.  The same postcards purchased in the hotel lobby have “ghost town” crossed out.  It’s five residents take umbrage at being called “ghosts.”  
        Ed runs the hotel.  He and his three partners are trying to restore the place.  Never mind that it’s way, way off any beaten track.  Never mind that Ed’s rigged up a heating system, consisting of wood-burning stoves and interlocking chimneys, that’s likely to burn it down—sooner, rather than later.  Ed seems to sense that.  
        “I got no insurance,” he told me when I went to check in.  “Something happens, you’re on your own.”  In fact, he made me sign a waiver.  Then he gave me a tour.  The love and labor he and his partners have put into the place is mind-boggling.  The day I was there, they were trying to jack and brace the building back into an upright alignment, a quarter inch at a time.  The whole hotel leaned toward the creek noticeably.
        That evening we all sat outside on the second floor veranda, listening to the building groan under the pressure of the braces, and watched the stars come out.  “There are spots on the Owyhee desert that are so remote there’s no artificial light at all,” Ed told me.  “You should see the stars there.”
        “Don’t leave without visiting the five cemeteries,” someone else suggested.  “Five?” I asked.  Turns out there was one for Jews, one for Chinese, one for Masons, one for Catholics and one for everybody else who used to mine the mines over a hundred years ago.  “God forbid that the wrong bones should mix,” someone commented.  
        Can anyone comprehend a billion years, I wondered.
        Then Ed got going about the bad habits of snowmobilers, who were his only winter trade.  They showed up, sat around his stoves, muddied his floors, ate the snacks he sold, and complained.  That’s when I decided the lack of tourist traffic probably wasn’t the problem I’d thought it was.  Ed doesn’t like tourists.  He happier when they don’t show up.  I leaned over the rail and placed some of the clearest cell phone calls of my trip and then went to bed without a light.  A suite at the Idaho Hotel comes complete with no running water and no electricity.  
        Are the people and the places depicted in this novel real?  
        No.  HoopSnaked is a work of fiction—a product of my imagination.  Drinkwater County, for example, is a made-up name for a made-up place, a composite of several places, some of which exist only in my head.  
        However, the modern West is real enough.  You can still find places “out there” that are so remote they seem older than cowboys, older than old Hollywood movies, places that are probably best described as Native Americans have always described them, as Old Man Coyote’s Country—tricky terrain.  You can go there if you’re willing to dispense with the usual expectations.  Highway 550 is not at the end of Main Street.
